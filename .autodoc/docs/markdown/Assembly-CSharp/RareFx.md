The code provided is a class called `RareFx` that is part of the larger Brick-Force project. This class is responsible for managing and updating a rare special effect that occurs in the game. 

The `RareFx` class has several private variables that store information about the current state of the effect, such as the current step of the effect (`rareFxStep`), the maximum duration for each step (`sizeUpMax`, `flyMax`, `bounceMax`), and the start and end positions of the effect (`start`, `end`). 

The class also has a public property called `Delta` that calculates the progress of the effect based on the current step and the elapsed time (`deltaTime`). This property is used to determine how much the effect should be scaled, moved, or animated at any given moment.

The class has a constructor that takes in the start and end positions of the effect and initializes the variables accordingly. The start and end positions are randomly adjusted by a small amount to add variation to the effect.

The class also has an `Update` method that is called every frame to update the state of the effect. This method increments the `deltaTime` variable by the time that has passed since the last frame. It then checks the current step of the effect and determines if it should transition to the next step based on the elapsed time. If the maximum duration for a step is reached, the `deltaTime` is reset and the effect transitions to the next step.

Overall, this class provides a way to manage and animate a rare special effect in the game. It can be used in the larger Brick-Force project to create visually appealing and dynamic effects that enhance the gameplay experience.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `RareFx` class?
- The `RareFx` class is responsible for managing the animation steps of a rare effect, such as size up, fly, bounce, and done.

2. What are the possible values for the `RAREFX_STEP` enum?
- The possible values for the `RAREFX_STEP` enum are `SIZE_UP`, `FLY`, `BOUNCE`, and `DONE`.

3. How is the `Delta` property calculated and what does it represent?
- The `Delta` property is calculated based on the current `rareFxStep` and the elapsed time (`deltaTime`). It represents the progress of the current animation step, ranging from 0 to 1.

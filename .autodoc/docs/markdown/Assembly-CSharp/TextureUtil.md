The code provided is a part of the Brick-Force project and is contained in the `TextureUtil` class. This class provides several static methods for drawing textures on the GUI in Unity.

The `DrawTexture` method is overloaded and can be used in different scenarios depending on the parameters passed. 

The first `DrawTexture` method takes a `Rect` position and a `Texture` image as parameters. It draws the texture at the specified position on the GUI. Before drawing, it checks if the GUI is enabled. If it is not enabled, it reduces the alpha value of the color to make the texture appear faded.

The second `DrawTexture` method is similar to the first one, but it also takes a `ScaleMode` parameter. This parameter determines how the texture should be scaled when drawn. The rest of the method is the same as the first one.

The third `DrawTexture` method is similar to the second one, but it also takes a `bool` parameter `alphaBlend`. This parameter determines whether the texture should be alpha blended when drawn. The rest of the method is the same as the second one.

The fourth `DrawTexture` method takes a `Rect` position, a `Texture` image, and a `Rect` source rectangle as parameters. It draws a portion of the texture specified by the source rectangle at the specified position on the GUI. This method is only executed when the current event type is `Repaint`. If the GUI is enabled, it simply draws the texture using the `Graphics.DrawTexture` method. If the GUI is not enabled, it reduces the alpha value of the color to make the texture appear faded before drawing.

These methods can be used in the larger Brick-Force project to draw textures on the GUI. They provide flexibility in terms of positioning, scaling, alpha blending, and drawing specific portions of a texture. Developers can use these methods to create visually appealing GUI elements such as buttons, panels, or backgrounds by drawing textures on the screen.
## Questions: 
 1. What does the `DrawTexture` method do?
- The `DrawTexture` method is used to draw a texture on the GUI at a specified position with various options such as scale mode, alpha blending, and source rectangle.

2. What is the purpose of the `Color` variable and how is it used?
- The `Color` variable is used to store the current GUI color. It is used to modify the alpha value of the color when GUI is disabled, making the texture appear faded.

3. What is the significance of the `Event.current.type.Equals(EventType.Repaint)` condition?
- The `Event.current.type.Equals(EventType.Repaint)` condition ensures that the texture is only drawn when the GUI is being repainted, preventing unnecessary drawing during other events.

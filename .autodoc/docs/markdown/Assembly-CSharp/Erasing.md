The code provided is a simple class called `Erasing` that is used to track the time elapsed between frames in a game or simulation. 

The `Erasing` class has a single public field called `deltaTime`, which is a float value representing the time in seconds between the current frame and the previous frame. 

The purpose of this class is to provide a way to measure the time between frames, which is useful for various game-related calculations and animations. For example, it can be used to control the speed of character movement, the rate of object spawning, or the timing of particle effects.

By updating the `deltaTime` field each frame, other parts of the game code can access this value and use it to calculate the necessary changes or animations based on the elapsed time. 

Here's an example of how this class might be used in a game loop:

```csharp
Erasing erasing = new Erasing();

while (gameRunning)
{
    // Calculate the time between frames
    float deltaTime = erasing.deltaTime;

    // Update game logic based on deltaTime
    UpdateGameLogic(deltaTime);

    // Render the game based on deltaTime
    RenderGame(deltaTime);

    // Wait for the next frame
    WaitForNextFrame();
}
```

In this example, the `deltaTime` value is passed to the `UpdateGameLogic` and `RenderGame` methods, which can use it to adjust the game state and render the game accordingly. This ensures that the game runs smoothly regardless of the frame rate or performance of the system it is running on.

Overall, the `Erasing` class provides a simple and convenient way to measure the time between frames in a game or simulation, allowing for more accurate and consistent animations and calculations.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the `Erasing` class?**
The `Erasing` class appears to be a class that is used to track the time elapsed since the last erasing action in the Brick-Force project.

2. **Why is the `deltaTime` variable declared as public?**
The `deltaTime` variable is declared as public, which means it can be accessed and modified by other classes or objects. It would be helpful to understand why this variable needs to be publicly accessible.

3. **Why is the `deltaTime` variable initialized to 0f in the constructor?**
The `deltaTime` variable is initialized to 0f in the constructor of the `Erasing` class. It would be useful to know if this initial value has any significance or if it is just a default value.

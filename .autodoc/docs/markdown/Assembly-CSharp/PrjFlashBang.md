The code provided is a class called `PrjFlashBang` that inherits from the `Projectile` class. This class represents a flashbang projectile in the larger Brick-Force project. 

The `Update` method is responsible for updating the state of the flashbang projectile every frame. It first increments the `deltaTime` variable by the time since the last frame. Then, it increments the `DetonatorTime` variable by the time since the last frame. If the `DetonatorTime` exceeds the `explosionTime`, it triggers the explosion by instantiating an explosion object at the current position of the projectile. It also calls a method in the `GlobalVars` class to switch on the flashbang effect and sends a network message using the `P2PManager` class to notify other players about the explosion. If there is a `projectileAlert` object, it removes the mine associated with the projectile. Finally, it destroys the game object of the projectile.

If the `DetonatorTime` does not exceed the `explosionTime`, the code checks if the `deltaTime` exceeds the `SendRate` property from the `BuildOption` class. If it does, it resets the `deltaTime` to 0 and sends a network message using the `P2PManager` class to update the position and rotation of the projectile. If there is a `projectileAlert` object, it tracks the mine associated with the projectile.

The `FixedUpdate` method is responsible for applying a torque force to the projectile's rigidbody component. This causes the projectile to rotate around the right axis.

The `Start` method is called when the projectile is first created. It checks if the `useUskWeaponTex` property from the `BuildOption` class is true. If it is, it retrieves all the `MeshRenderer` components attached to the projectile and checks if their main texture is not null and exists in the `UskManager` class. If it does, it replaces the main texture with the corresponding texture from the `UskManager`.

Overall, this code manages the behavior of a flashbang projectile in the Brick-Force project. It handles the detonation, updating position and rotation, and texture management.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `PrjFlashBang` class and how does it relate to the rest of the project? 
- The `PrjFlashBang` class is a subclass of the `Projectile` class and is used to handle the behavior of a flashbang projectile. It is likely used in the game's weapon system.

2. What is the significance of the `weaponBY` variable and how is it used in the code? 
- The `weaponBY` variable is of type `Weapon.BY` and is likely used to determine the type or category of the weapon associated with the flashbang projectile. It is used in the `projectileAlert.TrackMine()` method call.

3. What is the purpose of the `FixedUpdate()` method and how does it affect the behavior of the flashbang projectile? 
- The `FixedUpdate()` method is used to apply a torque force to the flashbang projectile's rigidbody component, causing it to rotate. This may be used to simulate a spinning motion for the projectile.

The code provided defines a class called `RadioSignal`. This class represents a radio signal and has three properties: `Sender`, `Category`, and `Message`, all of which are of type `int`. The class also has a constructor that takes in three parameters: `sender`, `category`, and `message`, and assigns them to the corresponding properties.

The purpose of this code is to provide a data structure for representing radio signals within the larger Brick-Force project. Radio signals are a means of communication within the project, and this class allows for the creation and manipulation of these signals.

By creating an instance of the `RadioSignal` class, developers can create and send radio signals with specific sender, category, and message values. For example, the following code creates a new `RadioSignal` object with a sender ID of 1, a category ID of 2, and a message ID of 3:

```csharp
RadioSignal signal = new RadioSignal(1, 2, 3);
```

This object can then be used to send the radio signal within the project, allowing other parts of the system to receive and process the signal based on its properties.

Overall, this code provides a simple and straightforward way to represent radio signals within the Brick-Force project. It allows for the creation and manipulation of radio signals, enabling communication between different components of the project.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the `RadioSignal` class?**
The `RadioSignal` class appears to represent a radio signal and contains three properties: `Sender`, `Category`, and `Message`. It is unclear what the purpose of this class is and how it is used within the project.

2. **What are the possible values for the `Sender`, `Category`, and `Message` properties?**
Without further information, it is unclear what range of values are valid for the `Sender`, `Category`, and `Message` properties. Understanding the possible values would provide more context for how this class is used.

3. **Are there any constraints or validations on the input parameters of the `RadioSignal` constructor?**
The `RadioSignal` constructor takes three integer parameters: `sender`, `category`, and `message`. It is unclear if there are any constraints or validations on these parameters, such as minimum or maximum values, or if they can be null. Understanding any constraints or validations would help ensure proper usage of the `RadioSignal` class.

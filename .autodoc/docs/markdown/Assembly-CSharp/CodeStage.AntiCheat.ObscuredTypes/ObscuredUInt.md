The code provided is a part of the Brick-Force project and it defines a struct called ObscuredUInt. This struct is used to store and manipulate unsigned integer values in an obscured manner, making it difficult for users to cheat or modify the values.

The ObscuredUInt struct has several private fields:
- cryptoKey: a static uint variable that represents the encryption key used to encrypt and decrypt the hidden value.
- currentCryptoKey: a uint variable that represents the current encryption key used for the hidden value.
- hiddenValue: a uint variable that stores the encrypted value.
- fakeValue: a uint variable that stores the decrypted value for comparison in case of cheating detection.
- inited: a bool variable that indicates whether the struct has been initialized.

The struct also has a public static Action variable called onCheatingDetected, which can be assigned a method to be called when cheating is detected.

The struct provides several methods and operators to manipulate the obscured unsigned integer values:
- SetNewCryptoKey: a static method that allows changing the encryption key.
- GetEncrypted: a method that returns the decrypted value if the currentCryptoKey matches the cryptoKey. Otherwise, it decrypts the hiddenValue using the currentCryptoKey and encrypts it again using the cryptoKey before returning it.
- SetEncrypted: a method that sets the hiddenValue to the provided encrypted value and checks for cheating by comparing the decrypted value with the fakeValue.
- Encrypt: static methods that encrypt a given value using the provided key or the cryptoKey.
- Decrypt: static methods that decrypt a given value using the provided key or the cryptoKey.
- InternalDecrypt: a private method that decrypts the hiddenValue using the currentCryptoKey and checks for cheating by comparing the decrypted value with the fakeValue.
- Equals, ToString, GetHashCode: overridden methods for comparison and string representation of the decrypted value.
- Implicit conversion operators: allow implicit conversion between ObscuredUInt and uint types.
- Increment and decrement operators: increment or decrement the decrypted value and update the hiddenValue accordingly.

The purpose of this code is to provide a secure way to store and manipulate unsigned integer values in the Brick-Force project. By encrypting the values and checking for cheating, it helps prevent users from modifying the values and cheating in the game. This struct can be used throughout the project to store and manipulate various unsigned integer values securely.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ObscuredUInt` struct?
- The `ObscuredUInt` struct is used to store and manipulate an unsigned integer value in an obscured manner, using encryption and decryption methods.

2. How does the encryption and decryption process work?
- The encryption process is performed by XORing the value with a crypto key. The decryption process is the same, XORing the value with the same crypto key.

3. What is the purpose of the `onCheatingDetected` action and how is it used?
- The `onCheatingDetected` action is used to handle a cheating detection event. It is triggered when the `SetEncrypted` method is called and the decrypted value does not match the previously stored fake value.

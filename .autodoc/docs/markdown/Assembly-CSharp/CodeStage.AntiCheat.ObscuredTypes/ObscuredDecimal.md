The code provided is a part of the Brick-Force project and it defines a struct called `ObscuredDecimal` in the `CodeStage.AntiCheat.ObscuredTypes` namespace. This struct is used to store and manipulate decimal values in an obscured manner, making it difficult for cheaters to modify the values.

The `ObscuredDecimal` struct contains several private fields, including `currentCryptoKey`, `hiddenValue`, `fakeValue`, and `inited`. These fields are used to store the encrypted decimal value, the current encryption key, a fake value for cheating detection, and a flag indicating whether the struct has been initialized.

The struct also contains a `DecimalLongBytesUnion` struct, which is used to convert between decimal values and their byte representation. This is done using the `FieldOffset` attribute to specify the memory layout of the struct.

The struct provides several methods for encrypting and decrypting decimal values. The `Encrypt` method takes a decimal value and encrypts it using the current encryption key. The `Decrypt` method takes an encrypted decimal value and decrypts it using the current encryption key. These methods use the `DecimalLongBytesUnion` struct to perform the encryption and decryption operations.

The `GetEncrypted` method returns the encrypted value stored in the `hiddenValue` field. If the current encryption key is different from the stored encryption key, the method first decrypts the value and then re-encrypts it using the current encryption key.

The `SetEncrypted` method takes an encrypted decimal value and stores it in the `hiddenValue` field. It also checks for cheating by comparing the decrypted value with the stored fake value.

The struct also provides methods for converting the obscured decimal value to a string representation using the `ToString` method. It also overrides the `Equals`, `GetHashCode`, and comparison operators to provide proper comparison and equality checks for obscured decimal values.

Overall, this code provides a way to store and manipulate decimal values in an obscured manner, making it difficult for cheaters to modify the values. It uses encryption and decryption techniques to protect the values and includes cheating detection mechanisms to detect any attempts to modify the values.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the ObscuredDecimal struct?
- The ObscuredDecimal struct is used to store and manipulate decimal values in an encrypted and obscured form.

2. How does the encryption and decryption process work for the ObscuredDecimal struct?
- The encryption process involves XORing the decimal value with a crypto key, and then converting the encrypted value into a byte array. The decryption process involves reversing the encryption steps and returning the decrypted decimal value.

3. What is the significance of the onCheatingDetected action?
- The onCheatingDetected action is a callback function that is triggered when cheating is detected. It is used to handle any actions or behaviors that should occur when cheating is detected in relation to the ObscuredDecimal struct.

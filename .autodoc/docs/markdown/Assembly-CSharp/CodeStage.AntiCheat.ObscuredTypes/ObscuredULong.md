The code provided is a struct called `ObscuredULong` that is used to encrypt and decrypt unsigned long integer values. It is a part of the CodeStage.AntiCheat.ObscuredTypes namespace.

The purpose of this code is to provide a way to store and transmit sensitive unsigned long integer values in an encrypted form, making it difficult for attackers to manipulate or cheat with these values. It achieves this by using a symmetric encryption algorithm, where the same key is used for both encryption and decryption.

The struct has several private fields:
- `cryptoKey`: a static ulong variable that holds the encryption key. By default, it is set to 444443uL, but it can be changed using the `SetNewCryptoKey` method.
- `currentCryptoKey`: an instance-level ulong variable that holds the current encryption key for a specific instance of `ObscuredULong`.
- `hiddenValue`: an instance-level ulong variable that holds the encrypted value.
- `fakeValue`: an instance-level ulong variable that holds the decrypted value for comparison in case of cheating detection.
- `inited`: an instance-level bool variable that indicates whether the struct has been initialized.

The struct provides several methods and operators for encryption, decryption, and manipulation of the encrypted value:
- `GetEncrypted`: returns the encrypted value. If the current encryption key is different from the global encryption key, it decrypts the value, re-encrypts it with the global encryption key, and updates the current encryption key.
- `SetEncrypted`: sets the encrypted value. If cheating detection is enabled (`onCheatingDetected` is not null), it also stores the decrypted value for comparison.
- `Encrypt`: static method that encrypts a ulong value using the global encryption key or a custom key.
- `Decrypt`: static method that decrypts a ulong value using the global encryption key or a custom key.
- `InternalDecrypt`: private method that decrypts the hidden value using the current encryption key. It also performs cheating detection by comparing the decrypted value with the stored fake value.
- `Equals`, `GetHashCode`, `ToString`: overrides of the respective methods from the Object class.
- `ToString`: overrides of the ToString method with different parameters.
- `implicit operator`: allows implicit conversion between ObscuredULong and ulong types.
- `++` and `--` operators: increment and decrement the decrypted value by 1, re-encrypt it, and update the fake value if cheating detection is enabled.

Overall, this code provides a way to securely store and transmit unsigned long integer values by encrypting them using a symmetric encryption algorithm. It also includes cheating detection functionality to detect any manipulation of the encrypted values. This struct can be used in the larger Brick-Force project to protect sensitive data and prevent cheating.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ObscuredULong` struct?
- The `ObscuredULong` struct is used to store and manipulate an unsigned long integer value with encryption and decryption capabilities.

2. How does the encryption and decryption process work?
- The encryption process is performed by XORing the value with a crypto key. The decryption process is the same, XORing the value with the crypto key.

3. What is the purpose of the `onCheatingDetected` action and how is it used?
- The `onCheatingDetected` action is used to handle a cheating detection event. It is triggered when the `SetEncrypted` method is called and the `fakeValue` is not equal to the decrypted value.

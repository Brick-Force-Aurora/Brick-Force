The code provided is a part of the Brick-Force project and it defines a struct called `ObscuredDouble` in the `CodeStage.AntiCheat.ObscuredTypes` namespace. This struct is used to store and manipulate double values in an obscured manner, making it difficult for cheaters to modify the values.

The `ObscuredDouble` struct implements the `IEquatable<ObscuredDouble>` interface, which allows for comparison of two `ObscuredDouble` instances.

The struct contains several private fields:
- `cryptoKey`: a static long variable that represents the encryption key used to encrypt and decrypt the double values.
- `currentCryptoKey`: a long variable that represents the current encryption key used for the instance.
- `hiddenValue`: a byte array that stores the encrypted value of the double.
- `fakeValue`: a double variable that stores the decrypted value of the double, used for cheating detection.
- `inited`: a boolean variable that indicates whether the struct has been initialized.

The struct also contains a static `Action` delegate called `onCheatingDetected`, which can be used to handle cheating detection events.

The struct provides several methods and operators for encrypting, decrypting, and manipulating the double values:
- `SetNewCryptoKey`: a static method that allows setting a new encryption key.
- `GetEncrypted`: a method that returns the encrypted value of the double.
- `SetEncrypted`: a method that sets the encrypted value of the double.
- `Encrypt`: a static method that encrypts a double value using the current encryption key.
- `Decrypt`: a static method that decrypts an encrypted value using the current encryption key.
- `InternalEncrypt`: a private method that encrypts a double value using a specified encryption key.
- `InternalDecrypt`: a private method that decrypts the encrypted value using the current encryption key.
- `ToString`: overrides the `ToString` method to return the decrypted value as a string.
- `Equals`: overrides the `Equals` method to compare two `ObscuredDouble` instances.
- `GetHashCode`: overrides the `GetHashCode` method to return the hash code of the decrypted value.
- `implicit operator`: provides implicit conversion between `ObscuredDouble` and double types.
- `++` and `--` operators: increment and decrement the decrypted value by 1.

Overall, this code provides a way to store and manipulate double values in an obscured manner, making it difficult for cheaters to modify the values. It also includes cheating detection functionality through the `onCheatingDetected` delegate. This struct can be used in the larger Brick-Force project to protect sensitive double values from cheating attempts.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the ObscuredDouble struct?
- The ObscuredDouble struct is used to store and manipulate double values in an encrypted and obscured form.

2. How does the encryption and decryption process work?
- The encryption process involves XORing the double value with a crypto key, and then converting the resulting value into a byte array. The decryption process involves XORing the byte array with the crypto key and converting it back into a double value.

3. What is the purpose of the onCheatingDetected action?
- The onCheatingDetected action is triggered when a potential cheating attempt is detected. It is used to handle any actions or behaviors that should occur when cheating is detected.

The code provided is a struct called `ObscuredInt` that is used to store and manipulate integer values in an encrypted and obscured manner. It is part of the `CodeStage.AntiCheat.ObscuredTypes` namespace.

The purpose of this code is to provide a way to store sensitive integer values in a way that makes it difficult for users to cheat or manipulate the values. It achieves this by encrypting the values using a crypto key and storing the encrypted value in the `hiddenValue` field. The original value is stored in the `fakeValue` field, which can be used to detect cheating attempts.

The `ObscuredInt` struct has several methods and properties that allow for encryption, decryption, and manipulation of the stored value. Some of the key methods and properties include:

- `GetEncrypted()`: This method returns the encrypted value of the `hiddenValue` field. If the crypto key has changed since the last encryption, it decrypts the value, re-encrypts it with the new key, and updates the `hiddenValue` field.

- `SetEncrypted(int encrypted)`: This method sets the `hiddenValue` field to the provided encrypted value. If cheating is detected (i.e., the `onCheatingDetected` action is not null), it sets the `fakeValue` field to the decrypted value.

- `Encrypt(int value)`: This method encrypts the provided value using the current crypto key and returns the encrypted value.

- `Decrypt(int value)`: This method decrypts the provided value using the current crypto key and returns the decrypted value.

- `InternalDecrypt()`: This private method is used internally to decrypt the `hiddenValue` field. If the struct has not been initialized, it initializes it by encrypting a value of 0. It then decrypts the `hiddenValue` field using the current or stored crypto key. If cheating is detected, it calls the `onCheatingDetected` action.

- `ToString()`: This method overrides the default `ToString()` method and returns the decrypted value as a string.

- `operator ++` and `operator --`: These operators allow for incrementing and decrementing the stored value. They decrypt the value, perform the operation, re-encrypt it, and update the `hiddenValue` field.

Overall, this code provides a way to store and manipulate integer values in an obscured and encrypted manner, making it difficult for users to cheat or manipulate the values. It can be used in the larger project to protect sensitive integer data and ensure the integrity of the game.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ObscuredInt` struct?
- The `ObscuredInt` struct is used to store and manipulate encrypted integer values.

2. How does the encryption and decryption process work?
- The encryption process is done using the XOR operation with a crypto key. The decryption process is the same, using the same crypto key.

3. What is the purpose of the `fakeValue` field?
- The `fakeValue` field is used to store the decrypted value of the `hiddenValue` field when cheating is detected.

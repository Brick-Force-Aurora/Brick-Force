The code provided is a class called "BannerViewer" that is used to display and manage banners in a lobby scene. The purpose of this code is to handle the rendering and interaction of banners within the lobby.

The class has several private variables, including a default texture for the banner, a fade texture, a reference to the main lobby object, and various timing variables. It also has a public method called "Start" that initializes the class by setting the fade texture and banner ID.

The class has a method called "SetupMain" that takes a reference to the main lobby object and sets it to the "main" variable. This method is likely used to establish a connection between the banner viewer and the main lobby.

The main functionality of the class is implemented in the "OnGUI" method. This method is responsible for rendering the banners and handling user interaction. It first checks if the banner ID is less than 0, and if so, it renders the default banner texture using the "TextureUtil.DrawTexture" method.

If the banner ID is greater than or equal to 0, it retrieves the banner texture from the "BannerManager" class using the "GetBnnr" method. If the retrieved texture is null, it uses the default banner texture. It then renders the banner texture using the "TextureUtil.DrawTexture" method.

The method also checks if the fade texture is not null. If it is not null, it applies a fade effect to the banner by changing the GUI color and rendering the fade texture using the "TextureUtil.DrawTexture" method.

The method then creates an array of strings with the same length as the number of banners in the "BannerManager" class. It sets each element of the array to an empty string. It then uses the "GUI.SelectionGrid" method to create a selection grid for the banners, allowing the user to switch between different banners. If the user selects a different banner, the "OnChangeBanner" method is called.

The method also checks if the user clicks on the banner using the "GlobalVars.Instance.MyButton" method. If the user clicks on the banner, it retrieves the corresponding banner object from the "BannerManager" class and performs an action based on the banner's action type. The possible actions include opening a URL, opening the shop tree, buying an item, or sending a request to a server.

The "Update" method is responsible for updating the fade effect and automatically switching banners after a certain amount of time. It checks if the fade texture is not null and updates the fade effect by incrementing the "deltaFade" variable. If the "deltaFade" variable exceeds a certain threshold, the fade texture is set to null.

The method also checks if there are any banners in the "BannerManager" class. If there are, it checks if the mouse is outside the banner area. If it is, it increments the "deltaTimeChangeBanner" variable and checks if it exceeds a certain threshold. If it does, it switches to the next banner by incrementing the banner ID and calling the "OnChangeBanner" method.

In summary, the "BannerViewer" class is responsible for rendering and managing banners in a lobby scene. It allows the user to switch between different banners and perform actions based on the selected banner. It also includes a fade effect for the banners and automatically switches banners after a certain amount of time.

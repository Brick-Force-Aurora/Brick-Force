The `ComposerTarget` class is a script that is used in the Brick-Force project. This script is responsible for managing the appearance and positioning of a target object in the game.

The script has three private variables: `mr`, `target`, and `transform`. `mr` is a reference to the `MeshRenderer` component attached to the game object that this script is attached to. `target` is a reference to a child game object called "TargetBox" that is expected to be present in the hierarchy. `transform` is a reference to the transform component of the game object.

In the `Start` method, the script initializes the `mr` and `target` variables by finding the `MeshRenderer` component and the "TargetBox" child object, respectively. This method is called when the game object is first created.

The `Update` method is empty and does not contain any code. This method is called every frame by the game engine, but in this case, it is not being used for any specific functionality.

The `ShowTarget` method is a public method that takes a boolean parameter `show`. It is used to control the visibility of the target object. If the `mr` variable is not null (meaning the `MeshRenderer` component was found), the `enabled` property of the `mr` variable is set to the value of the `show` parameter. This allows the target object to be shown or hidden based on the value passed to this method.

The `CenterAndSize` method is another public method that takes two `Vector3` parameters: `center` and `size`. This method is used to position and scale the target object. If the `target` variable is not null (meaning the "TargetBox" child object was found), the `localPosition` property of the `target` variable is set to the value of the `center` parameter, and the `localScale` property is set to the value of the `size` parameter. Additionally, a small offset of (0.05f, 0.05f, 0.05f) is added to the `size` parameter before setting the `localScale` property. This ensures that the target object is slightly larger than the specified size.

Overall, this script provides functionality to show or hide a target object and to position and scale the target object within the game world. It can be used in the larger Brick-Force project to create interactive elements that require a target object. For example, it could be used to create shooting range targets or objects that need to be hit by projectiles.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ComposerTarget` class?
- The `ComposerTarget` class is responsible for managing the appearance and positioning of a target object in the game.

2. What does the `ShowTarget` method do?
- The `ShowTarget` method controls the visibility of the target object by enabling or disabling its `MeshRenderer` component.

3. What does the `CenterAndSize` method do?
- The `CenterAndSize` method sets the position and scale of the target object based on the provided center and size vectors.

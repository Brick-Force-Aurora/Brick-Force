The code provided is a class called `TcStatus` that represents the status of a game feature in the larger Brick-Force project. This class is responsible for storing and updating various properties related to the status of the game feature.

The class has several private fields, including `seq`, `index`, `max`, `cur`, `key`, `maxKey`, `coinPrice`, `tokenPrice`, and `alias`. These fields represent different aspects of the game feature's status, such as the current sequence, index, maximum value, current value, key value, maximum key value, coin price, token price, and an alias.

The class also has a public property for each of these fields, allowing external code to access their values. For example, the `Seq` property returns the value of the `seq` field.

The class has a constructor that takes in values for all the fields and initializes them accordingly. There are also two `Update` methods that allow for updating the `cur`, `key`, and `maxKey` fields, or all the fields at once.

The class provides several methods for retrieving information about the status. The `GetTitle` method returns the alias of the game feature. The `GetDescription` method returns a string representation of the current value and maximum value. The `GetKeyDescription` method returns a string representation of the key value and maximum key value.

The class also provides methods for managing a list of `TcTItem` objects. The `ClearExpectations` method clears the list of items. The `AddExpectations` method adds an item to the list. The `GetRareArray` method returns an array of items from the list that are marked as keys. The `GetNormalArray` method returns an array of items from the list that are not marked as keys. The `GetArraySorted` method returns an array of items from the list, sorted so that the key items come first. The `TcTItemToArray` method returns the list of items as an array. The `GetFirstRare` method returns the first item from the list that is marked as a key.

Overall, this class provides a way to store and manage the status of a game feature in the Brick-Force project. It allows for updating the status, retrieving information about the status, and managing a list of related items.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `TcStatus` class?
- The `TcStatus` class represents the status of a game feature in the Brick-Force project, including information such as sequence, index, maximum value, current value, key value, coin price, token price, and alias.

2. What is the significance of the `Update` methods in the `TcStatus` class?
- The `Update` methods allow for updating the current value, key value, and maximum key value of the `TcStatus` object.

3. What is the purpose of the `GetArraySorted` method in the `TcStatus` class?
- The `GetArraySorted` method returns an array of `TcTItem` objects sorted by whether they are keys or not. Keys are placed before non-key items in the sorted array.

The code provided defines a class called `bombInfo`. This class is used to store information about a bomb in the larger Brick-Force project. 

The `bombInfo` class has three members: `bombId`, `isMyTeam`, and a method called `reset()`. 

The `bombId` member is an integer that represents the unique identifier of the bomb. The `isMyTeam` member is a boolean that indicates whether the bomb belongs to the player's team or not. 

The `reset()` method is used to reset the values of the `bombId` and `isMyTeam` members to their default values. In this case, the default value for `bombId` is -1 and the default value for `isMyTeam` is false. 

This class can be used in the larger Brick-Force project to keep track of bombs and their ownership. For example, when a bomb is placed in the game, an instance of the `bombInfo` class can be created and its members can be set accordingly. 

Here is an example of how this class can be used:

```csharp
bombInfo bomb = new bombInfo();
bomb.bombId = 1;
bomb.isMyTeam = true;

// ... some code ...

bomb.reset();
```

In this example, a new instance of the `bombInfo` class is created and assigned to the `bomb` variable. The `bombId` member is set to 1 and the `isMyTeam` member is set to true. Later in the code, the `reset()` method is called on the `bomb` object, which resets the values of `bombId` and `isMyTeam` to their default values (-1 and false, respectively).
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the `bombInfo` class?**
The `bombInfo` class appears to be a data structure that holds information about a bomb, including its ID and whether it belongs to the player's team.

2. **What does the `reset()` method do?**
The `reset()` method sets the `bombId` to -1 and `isMyTeam` to false, effectively resetting the bomb information to its default state.

3. **Are there any other properties or methods in the `bombInfo` class?**
Based on the given code, it is not clear if there are any other properties or methods in the `bombInfo` class. Further examination of the codebase or documentation would be needed to determine this.

The code provided defines a class called `MsgBox` that represents a message box in the Brick-Force project. The purpose of this class is to create message boxes with different types and messages.

The `MsgBox` class has an enumeration called `TYPE` that defines different types of message boxes. The available types are `ERROR`, `WARNING`, `SELECT`, `FORCE_POINT_CHARGE`, and `QUIT`. These types can be used to categorize and differentiate the message boxes based on their purpose or severity.

The class has two private fields: `msg` and `type`. The `msg` field stores the message content of the message box, while the `type` field stores the type of the message box.

The class provides two public properties: `Message` and `Type`. The `Message` property is a read-only property that returns the message content of the message box. The `Type` property is also a read-only property that returns the type of the message box.

The class also has a public method called `MsgColor` that returns the color associated with the message box type. If the type is `WARNING`, the method returns `Color.white`. Otherwise, it returns a custom color defined as `new Color(0.91f, 0.3f, 0f)`.

Lastly, the class has a constructor that takes two parameters: `_type` and `_msg`. These parameters are used to initialize the `type` and `msg` fields respectively.

This `MsgBox` class can be used in the larger Brick-Force project to create and display message boxes with different types and messages. Developers can create instances of the `MsgBox` class by providing the desired type and message, and then use the properties and methods of the class to access the message content, type, and associated color. For example:

```csharp
MsgBox errorBox = new MsgBox(MsgBox.TYPE.ERROR, "An error occurred!");
string errorMessage = errorBox.Message;
MsgBox.TYPE errorType = errorBox.Type;
Color errorColor = errorBox.MsgColor;
```

In the above example, an instance of `MsgBox` is created with the type `ERROR` and the message "An error occurred!". The properties `Message`, `Type`, and `MsgColor` are then used to access the message content, type, and color associated with the message box.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `MsgBox` class?
- The `MsgBox` class is used to create message boxes with different types (such as error, warning, select, force point charge, and quit) and corresponding messages.

2. How can the message and type of a `MsgBox` object be accessed?
- The message can be accessed using the `Message` property, and the type can be accessed using the `Type` property of a `MsgBox` object.

3. What color is returned for a `MsgBox` object of type `WARNING`?
- The color white is returned for a `MsgBox` object of type `WARNING`.

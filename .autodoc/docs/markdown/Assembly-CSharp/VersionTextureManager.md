The `VersionTextureManager` class is a script that manages the textures used in the Brick-Force project. It is responsible for handling the textures for building objects, seasonal objects, and movie publishing. 

The class has several public variables, including `buildObject`, `seasonObject`, `buildTexture`, `seasonTexture`, and `moviePublisher`. These variables are used to reference the game objects and textures that will be managed by the `VersionTextureManager`.

The class also has a private static variable `_instance` and a public static property `Instance`. This property provides a way to access the `VersionTextureManager` instance from other scripts. The `Instance` property uses the singleton pattern to ensure that only one instance of the `VersionTextureManager` is created. If there is no existing instance, it will attempt to find one using `Object.FindObjectOfType`. If no instance is found, an error message will be logged.

The `Awake` method is called when the script is first loaded. It uses `Object.DontDestroyOnLoad` to ensure that the `VersionTextureManager` object persists between scene changes. This is important because the textures managed by the `VersionTextureManager` should remain consistent throughout the game.

The `Start` method is called after the script is initialized. It retrieves the `ArmorTexture` component from the `buildObject` and assigns it to the `buildTexture` variable. Similarly, it retrieves the `SeasonTexture` component from the `seasonObject` and assigns it to the `seasonTexture` variable. These components are responsible for managing the textures for building objects and seasonal objects, respectively.

In summary, the `VersionTextureManager` class is responsible for managing the textures used in the Brick-Force project. It ensures that only one instance of the manager is created and provides a way to access that instance from other scripts. It also initializes the textures for building objects and seasonal objects. This class plays a crucial role in maintaining consistency and managing the textures throughout the game.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `VersionTextureManager` class?
- The `VersionTextureManager` class is responsible for managing version textures in the game.

2. What is the significance of the `buildObject` and `seasonObject` variables?
- The `buildObject` and `seasonObject` variables are GameObjects that are used to retrieve the `ArmorTexture` and `SeasonTexture` components, respectively.

3. What is the purpose of the `Awake()` and `Start()` methods?
- The `Awake()` method ensures that the `VersionTextureManager` object is not destroyed when a new scene is loaded, while the `Start()` method initializes the `buildTexture` and `seasonTexture` variables by retrieving the corresponding components from the `buildObject` and `seasonObject`.

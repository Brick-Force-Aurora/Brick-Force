The code provided is an example of how to use the `CodeStage.AntiCheat.Detectors` package in the Brick-Force project. This package provides functionality to detect cheating behaviors in the game, such as speed hacking and code injection.

The `DetectorsUsageExample` class is a MonoBehaviour script that is attached to a GameObject in the game scene. It has two public boolean variables, `injectionDetected` and `speedHackDetected`, which are used to track whether cheating behaviors have been detected.

In the `Start` method, the code sets up the detection for speed hacking and code injection. 

For speed hacking detection, the `SpeedHackDetector.StartDetection` method is called. This method takes three parameters: a callback function to be executed when a speed hack is detected (`OnSpeedHackDetected`), a float value representing the interval at which the detection should be performed (1 second in this case), and an integer value representing the number of consecutive detections required to trigger the callback (5 in this case). This means that if the speed hack is detected 5 times within 1 second, the `OnSpeedHackDetected` function will be called.

For code injection detection, the `InjectionDetector.StartDetection` method is called. This method takes a callback function to be executed when a code injection is detected (`OnInjectionDetected`). The `InjectionDetector.Instance.autoDispose` and `InjectionDetector.Instance.keepAlive` properties are also set to true. These properties control the behavior of the injection detector, with `autoDispose` indicating whether the detector should automatically dispose itself after detecting an injection, and `keepAlive` indicating whether the detector should keep running even if the game object it is attached to is destroyed.

The `OnSpeedHackDetected` and `OnInjectionDetected` methods simply set the corresponding boolean variables to true and log a warning message to the console.

Overall, this code sets up the detection for speed hacking and code injection and provides callback functions to handle the detection events. It allows the game to take appropriate actions when cheating behaviors are detected, such as banning the player or logging the incident for further investigation.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `SpeedHackDetector` and `InjectionDetector` classes?
- The `SpeedHackDetector` class is used to detect if a speed hack is being used in the game. The `InjectionDetector` class is used to detect if any code injection is occurring in the game.

2. What does the `StartDetection` method do and what are its parameters?
- The `StartDetection` method is used to start the detection process for either speed hacks or code injections. The parameters for the method include a callback function to be executed when a detection is made, a float value representing the detection interval, and an integer value representing the number of consecutive detections required to trigger the callback.

3. What is the purpose of the `autoDispose` and `keepAlive` properties of the `InjectionDetector` class?
- The `autoDispose` property is used to automatically dispose of the `InjectionDetector` instance when it is no longer needed. The `keepAlive` property is used to keep the `InjectionDetector` instance alive even if it is not actively detecting injections.

The code provided is a class called "KillInfo" that represents information about a kill event in the game. This class is likely used in the larger Brick-Force project to store and manage data related to kills that occur during gameplay.

The class has several private fields, including constants for the lifetime and alpha time of the kill info, as well as variables for the killer's name, victim's name, victim's sequence, killer's sequence, weapon texture, headshot texture, delta time, alpha value, dragY value, and weaponBy value.

The class also has several public properties that provide access to these private fields. These properties include "Killer", "Victim", "VictimSequence", "KillerSequence", "WeaponTex", "HeadShot", "IsAlive", "IsAlpha", "Alpha", "DragY", and "WeaponBy". These properties allow other parts of the code to read and modify the values stored in the private fields.

The class has a constructor that takes in several parameters, including the killer's nickname, victim's nickname, weapon image, headshot image, killer's sequence, victim's sequence, and the weaponBy value. The constructor initializes the private fields with the provided values and sets the delta time to 0.

The class also has an "Update" method that is likely called every frame in the game. This method increments the delta time by the time that has passed since the last frame. This allows the class to keep track of how long the kill info has been active.

Overall, this class provides a way to store and manage information about kill events in the game. It allows other parts of the code to access and modify this information as needed. For example, other parts of the code could use the "Killer" property to display the name of the player who made the kill, or use the "IsAlive" property to determine if the kill info is still active.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Update()` method in the `KillInfo` class?
- The `Update()` method is used to update the `deltaTime` variable by adding the current frame's time to it.

2. What is the significance of the `IsAlive` property in the `KillInfo` class?
- The `IsAlive` property returns a boolean value indicating whether the `deltaTime` is less than 5f, which determines if the `KillInfo` object is still considered alive.

3. What is the purpose of the `Alpha` property in the `KillInfo` class?
- The `Alpha` property is used to get or set the value of the `alpha` variable, which represents the transparency of the `KillInfo` object.

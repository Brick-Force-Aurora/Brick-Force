The code provided defines a class called `SettingParam`. This class is used to store and manage various settings parameters for a project called Brick-Force. 

The `SettingParam` class has four public variables: `fullScreen`, `width`, `height`, and `qualityLevel`. These variables are used to store the values of different settings parameters. 

The `fullScreen` variable is of type `bool` and is used to determine whether the project should be displayed in full screen mode or not. It can have two possible values: `true` if the project should be displayed in full screen mode, and `false` if it should not be displayed in full screen mode.

The `width` and `height` variables are of type `int` and are used to determine the dimensions of the project's display window. They store the width and height values in pixels.

The `qualityLevel` variable is also of type `int` and is used to determine the quality level of the project's graphics. It can have different values depending on the specific implementation of the project, with higher values indicating higher quality graphics.

The `SettingParam` class can be used in the larger Brick-Force project to manage and update the settings parameters. For example, it can be used to allow the user to change the display mode, window dimensions, and graphics quality level of the project. The class provides a convenient way to store and access these settings parameters in a structured manner.

Here is an example of how the `SettingParam` class can be used in the Brick-Force project:

```csharp
SettingParam settings = new SettingParam();

// Set the initial values of the settings parameters
settings.fullScreen = true;
settings.width = 1920;
settings.height = 1080;
settings.qualityLevel = 2;

// Update the settings parameters based on user input
settings.fullScreen = false;
settings.width = 1280;
settings.height = 720;
settings.qualityLevel = 1;

// Use the updated settings parameters in the project
if (settings.fullScreen)
{
    // Display the project in full screen mode
}
else
{
    // Display the project in windowed mode with the specified dimensions
}

// Adjust the graphics quality level based on the settings parameter
switch (settings.qualityLevel)
{
    case 0:
        // Set the graphics quality to low
        break;
    case 1:
        // Set the graphics quality to medium
        break;
    case 2:
        // Set the graphics quality to high
        break;
    default:
        // Set the graphics quality to a default value
        break;
}
```

In this example, the `SettingParam` class is used to store and update the settings parameters for the Brick-Force project. The values of these parameters are then used to control the display mode, window dimensions, and graphics quality level of the project.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the `SettingParam` class?**
The `SettingParam` class is likely used to store and manage various settings parameters for the Brick-Force project, such as fullscreen mode, width, height, and quality level.

2. **What are the possible values for the `fullScreen` variable?**
The `fullScreen` variable is a boolean type, so it can have two possible values: `true` for fullscreen mode enabled, and `false` for fullscreen mode disabled.

3. **What is the range of values for the `qualityLevel` variable?**
Without further information, it is not possible to determine the exact range of values for the `qualityLevel` variable. It could potentially represent a scale from low to high quality, or it could be a numerical value representing specific quality levels.

The code provided is a part of the Brick-Force project and is contained in the `WindowSystemManager` class. This class is responsible for managing the window system of the game.

The code starts by defining several constants that represent different window styles and flags. These constants are used later in the code to modify the window properties.

The class also contains several variables that are used to keep track of the window position and size, as well as flags for resizing and the current state of the window.

The `Instance` property is a singleton pattern implementation that ensures only one instance of the `WindowSystemManager` class is created. It uses the `FindObjectOfType` method to find an existing instance of the class or create a new one if none exists.

The `Awake` method is called when the object is initialized and sets the `DontDestroyOnLoad` flag to prevent the object from being destroyed when a new scene is loaded.

The `Start` method is empty and does not contain any code.

The `HideWindowBorderAndTitle` method is responsible for hiding the window border and title. It first checks if the game is not running in a duplicate executable mode and if the window currently has a border and title. If these conditions are met, it uses several Win32 API functions to modify the window properties and adjust its position and size.

The `ShowWindowBorderAndTitle` method is the opposite of `HideWindowBorderAndTitle` and is responsible for showing the window border and title.

The `Update` method is called every frame and is responsible for managing the window state based on certain conditions. If the game is not running in full-screen mode and not in a web player mode, it either hides or shows the window border and title based on whether the game is in a playing scene or not.

The remaining methods in the code are Win32 API function declarations that are used to interact with the window system. These functions are used to get and set window properties, find windows by name, adjust window rectangles, and get system metrics.

In summary, the `WindowSystemManager` class is responsible for managing the window system of the game. It provides methods to hide and show the window border and title, as well as manage the window state based on certain conditions. The Win32 API functions are used to interact with the window system and modify window properties.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `WindowSystemManager` class?
- The `WindowSystemManager` class manages the window system for the Brick-Force project, including hiding and showing the window border and title.

2. What is the purpose of the `HideWindowBorderAndTitle` method?
- The `HideWindowBorderAndTitle` method is used to hide the border and title of the window when the game is not in fullscreen mode.

3. What is the purpose of the `ReSize` method?
- The `ReSize` method is used to resize the window by adjusting its position and dimensions based on the difference between the client area and the window area.

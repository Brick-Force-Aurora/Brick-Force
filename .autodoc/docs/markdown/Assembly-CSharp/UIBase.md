The code provided is a class called `UIBase` that serves as a base class for user interface elements in the larger Brick-Force project. This class contains various properties and methods that are common to all UI elements.

The `UIBase` class has a protected boolean variable `isDraw` that determines whether the UI element should be drawn or not. It also has a public `Vector2` variable `position` that represents the position of the UI element on the screen. Additionally, there is a private `Vector2` variable `addPosition` that is used to add an offset to the UI element's position.

The class has a public property `IsDraw` that allows other classes to get or set the value of `isDraw`. This property provides a way to control the visibility of the UI element.

The `showPosition` property returns the sum of `position` and `addPosition`, which represents the final position of the UI element after applying any offset.

The class also contains several virtual methods that can be overridden by derived classes. The `Draw()` method is responsible for drawing the UI element on the screen and should be implemented in derived classes. The `SkipDraw()` method determines whether the UI element should be skipped during the drawing process. The `Update()` method is responsible for updating the state of the UI element and should be implemented in derived classes.

The class provides several helper methods for manipulating the `addPosition` variable. The `AddPositionX()` and `AddPositionY()` methods allow adding an offset to the UI element's position along the X and Y axes, respectively. The `ResetAddPosition()` method resets the `addPosition` variable to zero.

Overall, the `UIBase` class provides a foundation for creating and managing UI elements in the Brick-Force project. Derived classes can inherit from this base class and override its methods to implement specific UI functionality.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the `isDraw` variable and how is it used?**
The `isDraw` variable is used to determine whether or not the UI element should be drawn. It can be accessed and modified through the `IsDraw` property.

2. **What is the purpose of the `showPosition` property and how is it calculated?**
The `showPosition` property calculates the final position of the UI element by adding the `position` and `addPosition` vectors together.

3. **What is the difference between the `Draw()`, `SkipDraw()`, and `Update()` methods?**
The `Draw()` method is responsible for drawing the UI element, the `SkipDraw()` method determines whether the UI element should be skipped during drawing, and the `Update()` method is used for updating the UI element.

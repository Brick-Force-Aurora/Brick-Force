The code provided is a class called `ZombieModeConfig` that is used in the larger Brick-Force project. This class is responsible for handling the graphical user interface (GUI) elements and logic related to the zombie mode configuration in the game.

The `ZombieModeConfig` class contains various properties and methods that are used to display and interact with the zombie mode configuration in the game. Let's go through the code to understand its functionality:

1. The class is marked with the `[Serializable]` attribute, which allows instances of this class to be serialized and deserialized.

2. The class has several private fields that store the coordinates and dimensions of various GUI elements, such as thumbnails, buttons, and labels.

3. The `OnGUI` method is the main entry point for rendering the GUI elements related to the zombie mode configuration. It first retrieves the thumbnail image for the current map from the `RegMapManager` and assigns it to the `thumbnail` variable. If the thumbnail is not available, it falls back to the `nonavailable` texture.

4. The method then proceeds to render various GUI elements, such as the map thumbnail, icons for new maps, glory maps, medal maps, and gold ribbon maps. It also checks if the current map is flagged as an abuse map and renders an icon accordingly.

5. The method also displays the alias of the current map and the game mode associated with the current room.

6. The `DoOption` method is called to render additional GUI elements related to the game options, such as the round goal and the break-in option.

7. The `ShowTooltip` method is responsible for displaying a tooltip window when the user hovers over certain GUI elements. It renders the tooltip message passed to it at the current mouse position.

8. The `Start` method is empty and does not contain any logic.

In summary, the `ZombieModeConfig` class handles the rendering and interaction of GUI elements related to the zombie mode configuration in the game. It retrieves information about the current map and room from other classes, and uses that information to render appropriate GUI elements and handle user interactions. This class plays a crucial role in providing a user-friendly interface for configuring and managing the zombie mode in the Brick-Force game.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `OnGUI()` method?
- The `OnGUI()` method is responsible for rendering the graphical user interface elements related to the ZombieModeConfig class, such as textures, labels, and buttons.

2. What does the `DoOption()` method do?
- The `DoOption()` method is responsible for rendering and displaying options related to a specific room, such as the round number and the "break into" setting.

3. What is the purpose of the `ShowTooltip()` method?
- The `ShowTooltip()` method is responsible for displaying a tooltip message at the specified position on the screen. The tooltip message is retrieved from the `GUI.tooltip` property.

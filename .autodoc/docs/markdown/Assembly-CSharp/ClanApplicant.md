The code provided is a class called `ClanApplicant` that represents an applicant for a clan in the larger Brick-Force project. 

The class has several private variables: `name`, `seq`, `day`, `month`, and `year`. These variables are used to store information about the applicant's name and date of application. 

The class also has public properties for each of these variables: `Name` and `Seq`. These properties allow other parts of the code to access and modify the values of these variables. 

The class has a constructor that takes in the applicant's sequence number, name, and date of application as parameters. This constructor is used to create a new instance of the `ClanApplicant` class with the provided values. 

The class also has a public method called `GetDateToString()`. This method returns a string representation of the applicant's date of application in the format "year.month.day". The method achieves this by converting the integer values of `year`, `month`, and `day` to strings and concatenating them with periods in between. 

Overall, this code provides a way to create and store information about clan applicants in the Brick-Force project. The `ClanApplicant` class allows for the creation of new applicant objects with their respective sequence number, name, and date of application. The `GetDateToString()` method provides a way to retrieve the date of application in a specific format. 

Example usage of this code could be as follows:

```csharp
ClanApplicant applicant = new ClanApplicant(1, "John Doe", 2022, 10, 15);
Console.WriteLine(applicant.Name); // Output: John Doe
Console.WriteLine(applicant.GetDateToString()); // Output: 2022.10.15
applicant.Seq = 2;
Console.WriteLine(applicant.Seq); // Output: 2
```

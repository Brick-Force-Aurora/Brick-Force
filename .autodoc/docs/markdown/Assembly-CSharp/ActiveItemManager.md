The code provided is a part of the Brick-Force project and is contained in the file "ActiveItemManager.cs". This code is responsible for managing active items in the game. Active items are objects that can be collected and used by players to gain certain advantages or abilities.

The `ActiveItemManager` class is a MonoBehaviour that handles the creation, deletion, and usage of active items. It also manages the visual effects associated with active items.

The class has several public and private variables that store information about the active items. These variables include the GUI depth, the active item object, audio clips, effects, and various time-related variables.

The class also has a static instance property `Instance` that allows other classes to access the ActiveItemManager instance. This is implemented as a singleton pattern, ensuring that only one instance of the ActiveItemManager exists.

The `Awake()` method initializes some variables and sets up the itemIconEffect, which is responsible for displaying the active item icon on the screen.

The `Start()` method initializes the dicActiveItem dictionary, which stores the active items in the game.

The `Update()` method is called every frame and checks if a new active item needs to be created. If the maximum number of active items has not been reached, the method creates a new active item at a random position.

The `CreateActiveItem()` method creates a new active item at a random position and sends a network message to notify other players about the creation of the item.

The `IsValidPosition()` method checks if a given position is valid for placing an active item. It iterates through the dicActiveItem dictionary and checks the distance between the given position and the positions of existing active items. If the distance is less than a threshold value, the position is considered invalid.

The `EatItem()` method is called when a player collects an active item. It checks if the active item exists in the dicActiveItem dictionary and then proceeds to delete the item. If the player collecting the item is the master player, it also sends a network message to notify other players about the deletion of the item.

The `DeleteItem()` method deletes an active item from the game. It plays a sound effect, creates an itemGetEffect visual effect, and removes the item from the dicActiveItem dictionary. If the player collecting the item is the local player, it adds the item to the player's inventory and displays a message.

The `UseItem()` method is called when a player uses an active item. It instantiates the item's prefab and calls the UseItem method on the ActiveItemBase component attached to the prefab.

The `GetChoiceItemType()` method randomly selects an active item type based on their chances. Each active item has a chance value, and the method calculates the total chance value and selects a random number within that range. It then iterates through the active items and returns the index of the item whose chance range includes the random number.

The `ItemGetIconEffect()` method sets the texture image of the itemIconEffect to the icon of the active item and resets the effect.

The `OnGUI()` method is responsible for drawing the itemIconEffect on the screen.

The `GetActiveItemDictionary()` method returns the dicActiveItem dictionary, allowing other classes to access the active items.

Overall, this code provides the functionality to manage active items in the game, including their creation, deletion, and usage. It also handles the visual effects associated with active items.

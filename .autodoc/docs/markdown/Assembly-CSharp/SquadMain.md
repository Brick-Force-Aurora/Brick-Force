The code provided is a script for the SquadMain class in the Brick-Force project. This class is responsible for managing the main functionality of the squad system in the game. It handles the display of squad information, updates the squad members list, and manages the squad matching process.

The class contains several public variables that reference other classes and components in the game, such as ClanMemberListFrame, LobbyChat, SquadMemberListFrame, SquadMode, and SquadTool. These variables are used to access and manipulate the corresponding components in the game.

The Start() method is called when the script is initialized. It initializes the deltaTime variable and calls the Start() method of the clanMemberList, lobbyChat, squadMemberList, squadMode, and squadTool components. It also sets the chat style of the lobbyChat component to CLANMATCH.

The Update() method is called every frame. It updates the clanMemberList, lobbyChat, squadMemberList, squadMode, and squadTool components. It also checks if a certain amount of time has passed (0.5 seconds in this case) and performs some actions if it has. These actions include updating the dotCount variable, checking if the player has been exiled from their clan, and performing some cleanup actions if they have.

The OnClanExiled() method is called when the player has been exiled from their clan. It closes all open dialogs and context menus, displays a message to the player, sends some network requests to leave the squad and squading, clears the squad data, and loads the Lobby scene.

The MatchingProgress() method is called when the squad is in the matching process. It displays a progress message with dots indicating the progress of the matching process. It also checks if the player is the leader of the squad and displays a cancel button if they are.

The OnGUI() method is responsible for rendering the GUI elements of the squad system. It sets the GUI skin, draws the background texture, and displays various squad information such as the squad name, member count, and record. It also calls the OnGUI() methods of the clanMemberList, lobbyChat, squadMemberList, squadMode, and squadTool components.

The OnChat() method is called when a chat message is received. It enqueues the chat message to the lobbyChat component for display.

In summary, this code manages the main functionality of the squad system in the game. It handles the display of squad information, updates the squad members list, manages the squad matching process, and handles chat messages. It interacts with various components in the game to achieve these functionalities.

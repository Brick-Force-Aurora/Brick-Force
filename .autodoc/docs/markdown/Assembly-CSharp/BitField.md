The code provided defines a class called `BitField` that contains two static methods: `AddToBitfield` and `ReadFromBitfield`. The purpose of this class is to manipulate a bitfield, which is a data structure that represents a sequence of bits.

The `AddToBitfield` method takes three parameters: `ref int bitfield`, `int bitCount`, and `int value`. It adds the `value` to the `bitfield` by shifting the `bitfield` to the left by `bitCount` positions and then performing a bitwise OR operation with the `value`. This effectively appends the `value` to the rightmost `bitCount` bits of the `bitfield`. The `bitfield` parameter is passed by reference, meaning that any changes made to it inside the method will be reflected outside of the method.

Here is an example usage of the `AddToBitfield` method:

```csharp
int bitfield = 0b1010; // Initial bitfield value
int bitCount = 2; // Number of bits to add
int value = 0b11; // Value to add

BitField.AddToBitfield(ref bitfield, bitCount, value);

Console.WriteLine(Convert.ToString(bitfield, 2)); // Output: 101011
```

The `ReadFromBitfield` method takes two parameters: `ref int bitfield` and `int bitCount`. It reads the rightmost `bitCount` bits from the `bitfield` by performing a bitwise AND operation with a mask that consists of `bitCount` ones. It then shifts the `bitfield` to the right by `bitCount` positions. The method returns the extracted bits as an integer. Similar to `AddToBitfield`, the `bitfield` parameter is passed by reference.

Here is an example usage of the `ReadFromBitfield` method:

```csharp
int bitfield = 0b101011; // Bitfield value
int bitCount = 2; // Number of bits to read

int extractedBits = BitField.ReadFromBitfield(ref bitfield, bitCount);

Console.WriteLine(Convert.ToString(extractedBits, 2)); // Output: 11
Console.WriteLine(Convert.ToString(bitfield, 2)); // Output: 1010
```

In the larger project, this `BitField` class can be used to efficiently store and retrieve values that can be represented as a sequence of bits. It provides a way to manipulate individual bits within a larger bitfield, which can be useful in various scenarios such as encoding and decoding data, implementing custom data structures, or optimizing memory usage.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the BitField class?**
The BitField class appears to be a utility class for manipulating and reading values from a bitfield.

2. **What does the AddToBitfield method do?**
The AddToBitfield method adds a value to the bitfield by shifting the existing bits and then OR-ing the value.

3. **What does the ReadFromBitfield method do?**
The ReadFromBitfield method reads a value from the bitfield by performing a bitwise AND operation with a mask and then shifting the bitfield.

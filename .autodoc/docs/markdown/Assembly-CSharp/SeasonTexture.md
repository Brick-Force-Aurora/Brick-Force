The code provided is a part of the Brick-Force project and is contained within a file called "SeasonTexture.cs". This file defines a class called "SeasonTexture" that inherits from the "MonoBehaviour" class provided by the Unity game engine.

The purpose of this code is to define and store various textures and game objects related to different seasons in the game. The class has three public properties of type "Texture2D" named "texScreenBg", "texLoginBg", and "texDoneTutorial". These properties are used to store the textures for the background of the screen, the background of the login screen, and the texture for the completion of the tutorial, respectively.

Additionally, the class has a public property of type "GameObject" named "objPreviewBg". This property is used to store a reference to a game object that represents the background for a preview of the current season.

The class also contains two empty methods, "Start()" and "Update()". These methods are part of the Unity's MonoBehaviour lifecycle and are called automatically by the engine at specific times during the game. The "Start()" method is called once when the object is first created, and the "Update()" method is called every frame. These methods can be overridden and used to add custom logic or behavior to the game object.

In the larger project, this code can be used to manage and display different textures and game objects based on the current season in the game. For example, the "texScreenBg" texture can be used as the background for the main game screen, while the "texLoginBg" texture can be used as the background for the login screen. The "texDoneTutorial" texture can be used to indicate that the tutorial has been completed. The "objPreviewBg" game object can be used to display a preview of the current season's background.

Overall, this code provides a way to manage and display different textures and game objects based on the current season in the Brick-Force game.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the `Texture2D` variables `texScreenBg`, `texLoginBg`, and `texDoneTutorial`?**
   These variables likely hold different textures that are used for different screens or backgrounds in the game.

2. **What is the purpose of the `GameObject` variable `objPreviewBg`?**
   This variable likely holds a reference to a game object that represents the background for a preview screen.

3. **What functionality or behavior is expected to be implemented in the `Start()` and `Update()` methods?**
   The `Start()` and `Update()` methods are currently empty, so a smart developer might wonder what functionality or behavior is intended to be implemented in these methods.

The code provided is a script called "TimeLimitedParticleDestroyer" that is used in the larger Brick-Force project. This script is responsible for destroying particle effects after a certain amount of time has passed.

The script starts by declaring several variables. "particleTime" is a float variable that determines how long the particle effect will be active before it is destroyed. "lifeTime" is another float variable that determines the total lifespan of the particle effect. "particlePhase" is a boolean variable that keeps track of whether the particle effect is currently active or not. "deltaTime" is a float variable that keeps track of the time that has passed since the particle effect started.

In the "Start" method, the "particlePhase" variable is set to true and the "deltaTime" variable is set to 0. This ensures that the particle effect starts in an active state and the time counter is reset.

In the "Update" method, the "deltaTime" variable is incremented by the time that has passed since the last frame using "Time.deltaTime". This allows the script to keep track of the total time that has passed since the particle effect started.

The script then checks if the particle effect is currently active and if the "particleTime" has been exceeded. If both conditions are true, the script sets the "particlePhase" variable to false and disables the emission of particles by setting the "minEmission" and "maxEmission" properties of all ParticleEmitter components to 0. This effectively stops the particle effect from emitting any more particles.

Finally, the script checks if the "lifeTime" has been exceeded. If it has, the script destroys the game object that the script is attached to using "Object.DestroyImmediate".

In the larger Brick-Force project, this script can be used to control the lifespan of particle effects. By attaching this script to a game object that has particle effects, the effects will automatically be destroyed after a certain amount of time has passed. This can be useful for managing memory and performance by ensuring that particle effects are not active for longer than necessary.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `particlePhase` variable and how does it affect the behavior of the code?
- The `particlePhase` variable is used to control whether the particle emission is active or not. When `particlePhase` is true and `deltaTime` exceeds `particleTime`, the particle emission is disabled.

2. What is the significance of the `particleTime` variable and how does it relate to the `deltaTime` variable?
- The `particleTime` variable determines the duration (in seconds) after which the particle emission will be disabled. It is compared to the `deltaTime` variable to check if enough time has passed to disable the particle emission.

3. What is the purpose of the `lifeTime` variable and how does it affect the code?
- The `lifeTime` variable determines the duration (in seconds) after which the entire game object containing this script will be destroyed using `Object.DestroyImmediate()`. If `deltaTime` exceeds `lifeTime`, the game object will be destroyed.

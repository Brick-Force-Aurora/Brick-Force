The code provided is a class called `BundleDatas` that is a part of the Brick-Force project. This class is responsible for managing and storing various data related to items and bricks in the game.

The class has several boolean variables such as `saveItemMaterial`, `saveItemIcon`, `saveItemWeaponby`, `saveBrickMaterial`, and `saveBrickIcon`. These variables determine whether or not to save specific types of data. For example, if `saveItemMaterial` is set to true, it means that the item materials should be saved.

The class also has arrays of materials and textures such as `itemMaterials`, `itemIcons`, `itemWeaponby`, `brickMaterials`, and `brickIcons`. These arrays store the actual data for the items and bricks.

The `copyAll()` method is currently empty and does not have any functionality. It is likely that this method would be implemented in the future to copy all the data from one instance of `BundleDatas` to another.

In the larger project, this class would be used to manage and store the data for items and bricks. Other parts of the project, such as the inventory system or the level editor, would interact with this class to access and modify the data.

For example, if the inventory system needs to display the icons of all the items, it would access the `itemIcons` array in the `BundleDatas` class. Similarly, if the level editor needs to change the material of a brick, it would access the `brickMaterials` array.

Overall, the `BundleDatas` class plays a crucial role in managing and storing the data for items and bricks in the Brick-Force project. It provides a centralized location for accessing and modifying this data, making it easier to maintain and update the game.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the `copyAll()` method?**
The `copyAll()` method is defined in the code, but it is empty. A smart developer might wonder what functionality or logic is intended to be implemented in this method.

2. **What are the possible values for the boolean variables `saveItemMaterial`, `saveItemIcon`, `saveItemWeaponby`, `saveBrickMaterial`, and `saveBrickIcon`?**
The code declares several boolean variables, but it is not clear what values these variables can take. A smart developer might want to know the possible values in order to understand the behavior of the code.

3. **What is the purpose of the arrays `itemMaterials`, `itemIcons`, `itemWeaponby`, `brickMaterials`, and `brickIcons`?**
The code declares several arrays, but it is not clear what data these arrays hold or how they are used. A smart developer might want to know the purpose of these arrays in order to understand their role in the code.

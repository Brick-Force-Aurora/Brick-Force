The code provided is a part of the Brick-Force project and is responsible for controlling a post-processing effect called "BloomAndFlares" in the Unity game engine. 

The `PostEffectSwitch` class is a MonoBehaviour script that is attached to a game object in the scene. It contains two methods: `Start()` and `Update()`. 

In the `Start()` method, the script attempts to get the `BloomAndFlares` component attached to the same game object. If the component is found, it enables or disables the component based on the current quality level set in the Unity editor. 

The `GetComponent<BloomAndFlares>()` method is used to retrieve the `BloomAndFlares` component from the game object. If the component is found, it is assigned to the `component` variable. 

The `QualitySettings.GetQualityLevel()` method is then called to get the current quality level set in the Unity editor. The `>= 3` comparison checks if the quality level is greater than or equal to 3. If it is, the `enabled` property of the `BloomAndFlares` component is set to `true`, enabling the post-processing effect. If the quality level is less than 3, the `enabled` property is set to `false`, disabling the effect. 

The `Update()` method is empty and does not contain any code. It is likely left empty intentionally, as there is no need for any continuous updates or calculations in this script. 

Overall, this script is responsible for enabling or disabling the "BloomAndFlares" post-processing effect based on the quality level set in the Unity editor. It is likely used in the larger Brick-Force project to control the visual effects of the game and provide different levels of graphical fidelity based on the user's hardware capabilities.
## Questions: 
 1. **What does the `BloomAndFlares` component do?**
The smart developer might want to know the purpose and functionality of the `BloomAndFlares` component in order to understand its role in the code.

2. **What is the significance of `QualitySettings.GetQualityLevel() >= 3`?**
The developer might be curious about why the code is checking if the quality level is greater than or equal to 3 and how it affects the `enabled` property of the `BloomAndFlares` component.

3. **Why is the `Update()` method empty?**
The developer might wonder why the `Update()` method is present but does not contain any code, as it is a common method used for updating game logic.

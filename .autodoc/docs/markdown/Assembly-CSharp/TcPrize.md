The code provided is a class called `TcPrize` that is part of the larger Brick-Force project. This class represents a prize that can be won in the game. It contains various properties and methods to handle the prize's attributes and behavior.

The `TcPrize` class has the following properties:
- `tItem`: An instance of the `TItem` class, which represents the item that the prize is.
- `amount`: An integer representing the quantity of the prize.
- `deltaTime`: A float value that keeps track of the time passed since the prize was created.
- `flickering`: A float value that keeps track of the time passed since the last flickering effect.
- `outline`: A boolean value that determines whether the prize should be outlined or not.
- `isRareItem`: A boolean value indicating whether the prize is a rare item or not.

The class also has the following read-only properties:
- `Icon`: Returns the current icon of the prize, obtained from the `CurIcon()` method of the `tItem` object.
- `Name`: Returns the name of the prize, obtained from the `Name` property of the `tItem` object.
- `Code`: Returns the code of the prize, obtained from the `code` property of the `tItem` object.
- `AmountString`: Returns a string representation of the prize's amount, obtained from the `GetOptionStringByOption()` method of the `tItem` object.
- `IsRareItem`: Returns the value of the `isRareItem` property.

The `TcPrize` class has a constructor that takes a `Flying` object as a parameter. This constructor initializes the `tItem`, `amount`, `isRareItem`, `deltaTime`, `flickering`, and `outline` properties based on the values of the `Flying` object.

The class also has an `Update()` method that is called periodically to update the state of the prize. In this method, the `deltaTime` and `flickering` properties are incremented by the elapsed time since the last update. If the `flickering` value exceeds 0.3f, the `outline` property is toggled, creating a flickering effect.

Overall, this code provides a representation of a prize in the Brick-Force game. It allows for accessing and manipulating various properties of the prize, such as its icon, name, code, amount, and rarity. The `Update()` method is responsible for updating the state of the prize, including the flickering effect. This class can be used in the larger project to handle and display prizes won by players.
## Questions: 
 1. **What does this code do?**
This code defines a class called `TcPrize` that represents a prize in the game. It has properties for the prize's icon, name, code, amount, rarity, and whether it needs an outline. It also has a constructor and an update method.

2. **What is the purpose of the `Update` method?**
The `Update` method is called to update the `deltaTime` and `flickering` variables. It checks if `flickering` has exceeded a certain threshold and toggles the `outline` variable accordingly.

3. **What is the significance of the `Icon` property?**
The `Icon` property returns the current icon of the `tItem` object, which represents the prize. This property can be used to display the icon of the prize in the game's user interface.

The code provided is a class called `UIImageSizeChange` that extends the `UIBase` class. This class is responsible for changing the size of a UI image over time. It is likely used in the larger Brick-Force project to create dynamic and animated UI elements.

The `UIImageSizeChange` class has several properties and methods that control the size change behavior. 

The `texImage` property is of type `Texture2D` and represents the image that will be resized. 

The `startSize` property is a float that represents the initial size of the image. 

The `repeat` property is a boolean that determines whether the size change animation should repeat after reaching the end. 

The `sizeChange` property is a list of `SizeChangeStep` objects. Each `SizeChangeStep` object represents a step in the size change animation and contains information such as the target size, duration, and speed of the step.

The `curSize` property is a float that represents the current size of the image. 

The `curStep` property is an integer that represents the current step in the size change animation.

The `Update` method is responsible for updating the size change animation. It checks if the image is being drawn and if the necessary conditions are met to continue the animation. It then updates the current time and current size based on the speed of the current step.

The `Draw` method is responsible for drawing the resized image on the screen. It calculates the new size of the image based on the current size and the original image dimensions, and then uses the `TextureUtil.DrawTexture` method to draw the image.

The `AddStep` method is used to add a new step to the size change animation. It calculates the speed of the step based on the difference between the target size and the previous end size, divided by the duration of the step.

The `Reset` method is used to reset the animation to its initial state. It sets the current time, current size, and current step to their initial values.

The `SetEndStep` method is used to set the animation to its final step. It sets the current step to the last step in the animation and updates the current size accordingly.

Overall, this code provides a flexible and reusable way to animate the size change of UI images in the Brick-Force project. Developers can use the `UIImageSizeChange` class to create dynamic and visually appealing UI elements that change size over time.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `UIImageSizeChange` class?
- The `UIImageSizeChange` class is a subclass of `UIBase` and is responsible for changing the size of a UI image over time.

2. What does the `Update` method do?
- The `Update` method checks if the image is being drawn and if the current step of size change has been completed. It updates the current size of the image based on the speed and time of the current step.

3. What does the `Draw` method do?
- The `Draw` method draws the image on the screen using the current size and position. It returns false to indicate that the drawing is complete.

The code provided is for a class called "AfterImageEmitter" in the Brick-Force project. This class is responsible for creating and managing afterimages of a game object. 

The class has several member variables:
- `componentsToDel` is an array of strings that represents the names of the components to be removed from the afterimage object.
- `minDistance` is a float that represents the minimum distance required for the game object to move before creating a new afterimage.
- `lastPosition` is a Vector3 that stores the last position of the game object.
- `afterImage` is a boolean that determines whether the afterimage should be shown or not.

The class has three methods:
- `ShowAfterImage(bool show)` is a public method that sets the value of `afterImage` based on the input parameter. If `show` is true, it calls the `Shoot()` method to create a new afterimage.
- `Shoot()` is a private method that creates a new afterimage game object by instantiating a copy of the current game object. It then removes the specified components from the afterimage object, adds a `FadeOutDestroyer` component, and updates the `lastPosition` variable.
- `Update()` is a private method that is called every frame. If `afterImage` is true and the distance between the current position and the last position is greater than `minDistance`, it calls the `Shoot()` method to create a new afterimage.

In the larger project, this class can be used to create afterimages for game objects that move. The `ShowAfterImage()` method can be called to toggle the visibility of the afterimage, and the `minDistance` variable can be adjusted to control how often afterimages are created. The `componentsToDel` array can be used to specify which components should be removed from the afterimage object, allowing for customization of the afterimage appearance.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `componentsToDel` array?
- The `componentsToDel` array is used to store the names of components that should be removed from the instantiated game object in the `Shoot()` method.

2. What does the `ShowAfterImage()` method do?
- The `ShowAfterImage()` method sets the value of the `afterImage` variable and calls the `Shoot()` method if `afterImage` is true.

3. What is the purpose of the `minDistance` variable?
- The `minDistance` variable is used to determine the minimum distance required for the `Shoot()` method to be called in the `Update()` method.

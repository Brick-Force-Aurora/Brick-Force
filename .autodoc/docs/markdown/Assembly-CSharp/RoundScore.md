The code provided defines a class called `RoundScore`. This class has two public integer variables `_cur` and `_total`, which represent the current score and the total score for a round, respectively. The class also has a constructor that takes two integer parameters `cur` and `total` and assigns them to the corresponding variables.

The purpose of this code is to create an object that represents the score for a round in a game. By encapsulating the current and total scores within an object, it allows for easier manipulation and tracking of the scores throughout the game.

This `RoundScore` class can be used in the larger project to keep track of the scores for each round of the game. For example, if the game has multiple rounds and the scores need to be displayed to the player, an instance of the `RoundScore` class can be created for each round and the current and total scores can be updated accordingly.

Here is an example of how this class can be used:

```java
RoundScore round1Score = new RoundScore(50, 100);
System.out.println("Current score for round 1: " + round1Score._cur);
System.out.println("Total score for round 1: " + round1Score._total);

// Update the scores for round 1
round1Score._cur += 10;
round1Score._total += 10;

System.out.println("Updated current score for round 1: " + round1Score._cur);
System.out.println("Updated total score for round 1: " + round1Score._total);
```

In this example, we create an instance of `RoundScore` called `round1Score` with an initial current score of 50 and a total score of 100. We then print out the current and total scores. After that, we update the scores by adding 10 to both the current and total scores and print out the updated scores.

Overall, this code provides a simple and reusable way to represent and manipulate the scores for each round of a game in the larger project.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the `RoundScore` class?**
The `RoundScore` class appears to be a representation of a score for a round in a game. It has two properties, `_cur` and `_total`, which likely represent the current score and the total score for the round.

2. **What is the significance of the `public` access modifier for the `_cur` and `_total` properties?**
The `public` access modifier indicates that the `_cur` and `_total` properties can be accessed from outside the `RoundScore` class. This means that other classes or objects can read or modify these properties directly.

3. **Why does the `RoundScore` class have a constructor that takes two integer parameters?**
The constructor allows the creation of a new `RoundScore` object with initial values for the `_cur` and `_total` properties. This allows for flexibility in initializing the object with specific values when needed.

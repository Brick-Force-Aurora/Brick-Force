The code provided is a part of the Brick-Force project and is contained in a file called "SteamManager.cs". This code is responsible for managing the integration of the Steam API into the project.

The `SteamManager` class is a MonoBehaviour, which means it can be attached to a GameObject in the Unity engine. It has a private boolean variable `_loaded` and a private static instance of the `SteamManager` class called `_instance`.

The purpose of the `SteamManager` class is to provide a way to access the SteamManager instance and to handle the initialization and shutdown of the Steam API. The `Instance` property is a getter that returns the `_instance` variable. If the `_instance` variable is null, it tries to find an existing instance of the `SteamManager` class using `Object.FindObjectOfType`. If it fails to find an instance, it logs an error message. This ensures that there is only one instance of the `SteamManager` class in the project.

The `Awake` method is called when the script instance is being loaded. It uses `Object.DontDestroyOnLoad` to prevent the `SteamManager` object from being destroyed when a new scene is loaded.

The `Start` and `Update` methods are empty and do not contain any code.

The `OnDestroy` method is called when the script instance is being destroyed. If the `_loaded` variable is true, it calls `SteamDLL.SteamAPI_Shutdown()` to shut down the Steam API and sets `_loaded` to false.

The `LoadSteamDll` method is responsible for loading the Steam DLL and initializing the Steam API. It first checks if the `UseSteam` property in the `BuildOption.Instance.Props` object is false. If it is false, it returns true, indicating that the Steam DLL is not needed. If `_loaded` is false, it calls `SteamDLL.SteamAPI_Init()` to initialize the Steam API and sets `_loaded` to true. It then returns the value of `_loaded`.

In summary, the `SteamManager` class provides a way to access the SteamManager instance and handles the initialization and shutdown of the Steam API. It ensures that there is only one instance of the `SteamManager` class in the project and provides a method to load the Steam DLL and initialize the Steam API. This code is an essential part of the Brick-Force project as it allows for integration with the Steam platform.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the SteamManager class?
- The SteamManager class is responsible for managing the Steam API and initializing it.

2. What is the purpose of the Awake() method?
- The Awake() method is called when the script instance is being loaded, and it ensures that the SteamManager object is not destroyed when loading a new scene.

3. What is the purpose of the LoadSteamDll() method?
- The LoadSteamDll() method is used to load the Steam DLL and initialize the Steam API, if the BuildOption allows it.

The code provided is a class called "SquadTool" that is used in the larger Brick-Force project. This class is responsible for handling the GUI (Graphical User Interface) interactions related to managing a squad in the game.

The class has several private variables of type "Rect" that define the positions and sizes of GUI elements on the screen. These variables are used to create and position buttons in the GUI.

The class has a public method called "Start" that takes a parameter of type "SquadMemberListFrame". This method is called to initialize the "squadMemberList" variable with the provided "squadMemberListFrame" object.

The class has a public method called "Update" that currently does nothing. This method is likely intended to be used for updating the state of the squad tool, but it is empty in the provided code.

The class has a public method called "OnGUI" that is responsible for rendering the GUI elements and handling user interactions. 

Inside the "OnGUI" method, the code first checks if the current squad exists and if the player is the leader of the squad. If both conditions are true, it proceeds to check if a squad member is selected and if the selected member is not the player themselves. If these conditions are also true, it creates a button with the label "EXILE" at the position defined by the "crdCreate" variable. 

If the "EXILE" button is clicked, it sends a request to kick the selected squad member using the "CSNetManager" class.

After that, the code checks if the "Back" button is clicked or if the escape key is pressed. If either of these conditions is true, it sends a request to leave the squad using the "CSNetManager" class, leaves the squad using the "SquadManager" class, and loads the "Squading" scene using the "Application" class.

In summary, this code is responsible for rendering and handling GUI elements related to managing a squad in the Brick-Force game. It allows the player to kick squad members and leave the squad.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Start` method and what does it do?
- The `Start` method initializes the `squadMemberList` variable with the provided `squadMemberListFrame` parameter.

2. What is the purpose of the `Update` method and what does it do?
- The `Update` method is currently empty and does not have any functionality. It might be used for updating the state of the `SquadTool` object in the future.

3. What is the purpose of the `OnGUI` method and what does it do?
- The `OnGUI` method handles the graphical user interface (GUI) for the `SquadTool` object. It checks if the current squad leader wants to kick a selected member and handles the button actions for leaving the squad.

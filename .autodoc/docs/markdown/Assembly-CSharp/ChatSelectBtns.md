The `ChatSelectBtns` class is responsible for managing the chat modes in the Brick-Force project. It provides functionality to switch between different chat modes, such as general chat, clan chat, and team chat. 

The class has several private variables, including `crdCombo`, which represents the position and size of the chat mode selection box, `chatModes`, which is an array of strings representing the different chat modes, `cbox`, which is an instance of the `ComboBox` class used for displaying the chat mode selection box, `IsBattle`, a boolean flag indicating whether the chat mode is for a battle or not, `selected`, an integer representing the index of the currently selected chat mode, `chatView`, a boolean flag indicating whether the chat view is enabled or not, and `chatMode`, an enum representing the current chat mode.

The class has several public methods, including `chatModeLobby()` and `chatModeBattle()`, which set the `IsBattle` flag and populate the `chatModes` array with the appropriate chat mode strings based on the current input keys. The `OnGUI()` method is responsible for rendering the chat mode selection box and handling user input to change the selected chat mode. The `changeChildIdx()` method is used to change the selected item index of the `cbox` instance based on the provided chat type. The `rcBox()` methods are used to update the position of the chat mode selection box. The `VerifyChatView()` method is responsible for checking the current chat view state in the game and updating the `chatView` flag accordingly. The `changeParentChatMode()` method is used to update the chat mode in the parent chat components based on the current selected chat mode. The `Update()` method is responsible for calling the `VerifyChatView()` method to update the chat view state.

Overall, this class provides the functionality to switch between different chat modes in the Brick-Force project. It is used to manage the chat view and update the chat mode in the parent chat components based on the user's selection.

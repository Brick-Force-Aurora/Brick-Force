The code provided is a class called `ResultUnitZombie` that extends another class called `ResultUnit`. This class represents a specific type of result unit for a zombie in the larger Brick-Force project.

The `ResultUnitZombie` class has a public integer variable called `winCount`, which represents the total number of wins for the zombie. This variable is initialized in the constructor of the class by adding the values of `_kill` and `_death` parameters.

The class also has a method called `Compare`, which takes an instance of `ResultUnitZombie` as a parameter and returns an integer value. This method is used to compare two instances of `ResultUnitZombie` based on their scores, win counts, and sequence numbers.

The comparison logic in the `Compare` method is as follows:
- If the scores of the two instances are equal, it compares their win counts.
- If the win counts are also equal, it compares their sequence numbers.
- If the scores are not equal, it compares their scores.

The comparison is done using the `CompareTo` method, which returns a negative value if the current instance is less than the parameter instance, a positive value if it is greater, and zero if they are equal.

This class is likely used in the larger Brick-Force project to represent and compare the results of zombie units in the game. It provides a way to sort and rank the zombie units based on their scores, win counts, and sequence numbers. This information can be used for various purposes, such as determining the leaderboard or calculating rewards for the players.

Example usage:
```csharp
ResultUnitZombie zombie1 = new ResultUnitZombie(true, 1, "Zombie1", 10, 5, 3, 100, 50, 1000, 1, 900, 1100, 123456789);
ResultUnitZombie zombie2 = new ResultUnitZombie(true, 2, "Zombie2", 8, 7, 2, 90, 40, 900, 1, 800, 1000, 987654321);

int comparisonResult = zombie1.Compare(zombie2);
Console.WriteLine(comparisonResult); // Output: 1 (zombie1 is ranked higher than zombie2)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Compare` method in the `ResultUnitZombie` class?
- The `Compare` method is used to compare two `ResultUnitZombie` objects based on their `score`, `winCount`, and `seq` properties.

2. What does the `winCount` property represent in the `ResultUnitZombie` class?
- The `winCount` property represents the total number of wins for a `ResultUnitZombie` object, which is calculated by adding the `kill` and `death` properties.

3. What is the significance of the negative sign in the return statements of the `Compare` method?
- The negative sign is used to indicate that the comparison result should be in descending order. So, a negative value means that the current object should be ranked higher than the compared object.

The `ZombieTimer` class is a script that is used to manage the timer for a zombie game in the larger Brick-Force project. 

The purpose of this code is to display a timer on the game screen and update it based on the game progress. The timer is displayed as a countdown in minutes and seconds. The timer starts at a specified time limit and decreases by one second every second until it reaches zero. 

The code uses the Unity game engine and the `UnityEngine` namespace. It also relies on other classes and components from the larger Brick-Force project, such as `GUIDepth`, `UIImageSizeChange`, `LocalController`, `ZombieMatch`, `RoomManager`, `MyInfoManager`, `DialogManager`, `GUISkinFinder`, `LabelUtil`, `TextureUtil`, `CSNetManager`, and `BrickManager`.

The `ZombieTimer` class has several member variables that store information about the timer and its components. These variables include `guiDepth`, `offset`, `bkgnd`, `backChange`, `play`, `dummyDelta`, `playDelta`, `deltaTime`, `remain`, `localController`, `zombieMatch`, and `expandArea`.

The `Start` method is called when the script is first initialized. It initializes the member variables, finds the player object in the game scene, and gets the `LocalController` and `ZombieMatch` components attached to the player object. It also sets the position and size of the background image for the timer.

The `OnGUI` method is called every frame to update the graphical user interface. It checks if the GUI is enabled and then draws the timer on the screen. If the remaining time is less than 11 seconds, it uses a special effect to draw the timer in red. Otherwise, it draws the timer in yellow.

The `Update` method is called every frame to update the timer logic. It checks if the player is the master of the game, if the `ZombieMatch` component exists, if the `LocalController` component exists, and if the `BrickManager` is loaded. If all these conditions are met, it updates the timer based on the game state. If the player is not a spectator, it updates the timer based on the `ZombieMatch` step. If the step is not `ZOMBIE_PLAY`, it sends a timer request to the server every second. If the step is `ZOMBIE_PLAY`, it increments the play time every second and sends a timer request to the server. It also updates the remaining time every second and sends a timer request to the server.

The `OnPlayTime` and `OnTimer` methods are event handlers that are called when the server sends updates about the play time and remaining time, respectively. They update the local variables `play` and `remain` if the received values are greater than the current values.

Overall, this code manages the timer for a zombie game in the Brick-Force project, displaying it on the screen and updating it based on the game progress.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ZombieTimer` class?
- The `ZombieTimer` class is responsible for managing the timer for a zombie game mode in the Brick-Force project.

2. What is the significance of the `remain` variable?
- The `remain` variable represents the remaining time in seconds for the game mode.

3. What is the purpose of the `backChange` object?
- The `backChange` object is used to animate the background image of the timer.

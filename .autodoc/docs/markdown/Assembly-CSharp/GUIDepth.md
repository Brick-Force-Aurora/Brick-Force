The code provided defines a public class called `GUIDepth` that contains an enum called `LAYER`. This enum represents different layers or depths that can be used in a graphical user interface (GUI) system. Each layer is assigned a specific value, which determines its position in the GUI hierarchy.

The purpose of this code is to provide a standardized way of organizing and managing the different layers in the GUI system of the Brick-Force project. By using this enum, developers can easily reference and manipulate the different layers in their code.

For example, if a developer wants to display a loading screen on top of all other GUI elements, they can set the layer of the loading screen to `LOADING`:

```csharp
GUIElement loadingScreen = new GUIElement();
loadingScreen.Layer = GUIDepth.LAYER.LOADING;
```

Similarly, if a developer wants to display a menu below the loading screen but above the game controls, they can set the layer of the menu to `MENU`:

```csharp
GUIElement menu = new GUIElement();
menu.Layer = GUIDepth.LAYER.MENU;
```

This code can be used throughout the project to ensure consistent layering of GUI elements. It provides a clear and intuitive way for developers to understand and manage the depth of different GUI components.

In the larger context of the Brick-Force project, this code is likely used in conjunction with other GUI-related classes and components to create a visually appealing and interactive user interface. By defining and using specific layers, the project can ensure that GUI elements are displayed in the correct order and hierarchy, improving the overall user experience.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the `GUIDepth` class?**
The `GUIDepth` class is likely used to define and organize the different layers of the graphical user interface (GUI) in the Brick-Force project.

2. **What is the significance of the values assigned to each layer in the `LAYER` enum?**
The values assigned to each layer in the `LAYER` enum likely determine the order in which the GUI elements are rendered, with lower values being rendered first and higher values being rendered last.

3. **Are there any other classes or components that interact with the `GUIDepth` class?**
To fully understand the role and functionality of the `GUIDepth` class, it would be helpful to know if there are any other classes or components that interact with it, such as a GUI manager or renderer.

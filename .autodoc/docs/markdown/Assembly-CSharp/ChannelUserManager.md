The `ChannelUserManager` class is responsible for managing the users in a channel. It keeps track of the users in a dictionary, where the key is the user's sequence number and the value is an instance of the `NameCard` class.

The `ChannelUserManager` class is a singleton, meaning that there can only be one instance of it in the project. The singleton pattern is implemented using a static property `Instance` and a private static field `_instance`. The `Instance` property ensures that there is only one instance of the `ChannelUserManager` class and provides a way to access that instance from other parts of the project.

The `Awake` method is called when the `ChannelUserManager` object is created. It initializes the dictionary `dic` and ensures that the object is not destroyed when a new scene is loaded using `Object.DontDestroyOnLoad(this)`.

The `Refresh` method is called periodically to refresh the user list. It checks if enough time has passed since the last refresh and if so, sends a request to the server to get the updated list of users in the channel.

The `AddUser` method is used to add a new user to the dictionary. If the user with the given sequence number does not exist in the dictionary, a new `NameCard` object is created and added to the dictionary. If the user already exists in the dictionary, the `Lv`, `Rank`, and `SvrId` properties of the existing `NameCard` object are updated.

The `Clear` method is used to clear the dictionary and reset the `deltaTime` variable.

The `DelUser` method is used to remove a user from the dictionary based on their sequence number.

The `GetUser` method is used to retrieve a `NameCard` object from the dictionary based on the user's sequence number.

The `ContainsUser` method is used to check if a user with the given sequence number exists in the dictionary.

The `ToArray` method is used to convert the dictionary of `NameCard` objects into an array of `NameCard` objects.

Overall, the `ChannelUserManager` class provides a way to manage and manipulate the users in a channel. It allows for adding, removing, and retrieving user information, as well as refreshing the user list from the server. This class is likely used in conjunction with other classes and components in the larger project to display and interact with the users in the channel.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ChannelUserManager` class?
- The `ChannelUserManager` class is responsible for managing a dictionary of `NameCard` objects, which represent users in a channel.

2. What is the significance of the `Instance` property?
- The `Instance` property is a singleton pattern implementation that ensures there is only one instance of the `ChannelUserManager` class throughout the application.

3. What does the `Refresh` method do?
- The `Refresh` method updates the `deltaTime` variable and sends a request to the `CSNetManager` to retrieve the player list for the current channel if the `deltaTime` exceeds 3 seconds.

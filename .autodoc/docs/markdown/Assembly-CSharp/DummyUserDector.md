The code provided is a script called "DummyUserDector" that is part of the larger Brick-Force project. This script is responsible for detecting and managing dummy users in the game.

The script starts by defining an enum called "USER_TYPE" which has two possible values: "ACTIVE_USER" and "LAZY_USER". This enum is used to keep track of the type of user the script is currently dealing with.

The script also declares several private variables:
- "dummyTime" is a float that keeps track of the time elapsed since the dummy user was last cleared.
- "timeout" is a float that represents the maximum amount of time a dummy user can be active before being cleared.
- "userType" is a variable of type "USER_TYPE" that stores the current type of user.

The script contains several methods:
- "Awake" is called when the script is first loaded. It uses the "DontDestroyOnLoad" method to ensure that the script persists between scene changes.
- "Start" is called at the beginning of the game. It calls the "Clear" method to reset the dummy user.
- "Clear" is a private method that resets the dummy user by setting the "userType" to "ACTIVE_USER" and resetting the "dummyTime" to 0.
- "Update" is called every frame. It checks several conditions to determine if the dummy user should be cleared or if it should transition from an active user to a lazy user. If the dummy user has been active for a certain amount of time, it is cleared and various actions are taken, such as setting a global variable to shut down the game, sending a logout request to the server, closing the network socket, and displaying a message box.

In the larger Brick-Force project, this script is likely used to manage and handle dummy users in the game. Dummy users are typically used for testing or simulation purposes and are not real players. This script ensures that dummy users are cleared after a certain amount of time and performs necessary actions when they are cleared. It also handles the transition from an active user to a lazy user if the dummy user has been active for a specific duration.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Awake()` method and why is `Object.DontDestroyOnLoad(this)` called within it?
- The `Awake()` method is called when the script instance is being loaded. `Object.DontDestroyOnLoad(this)` is called to prevent the object from being destroyed when a new scene is loaded.

2. What conditions need to be met for the code within the `Update()` method to execute?
- The conditions that need to be met are: `MyInfoManager.Instance.Seq` is greater than 0, `BuffManager.Instance.netCafeCode` is equal to 0, `CSNetManager.Instance.Sock` is not null, and `CSNetManager.Instance.Sock.IsConnected()` returns true.

3. What does the code do when `dummyTime` reaches the `timeout` value?
- When `dummyTime` reaches the `timeout` value, the code calls the `Clear()` method, sets `GlobalVars.Instance.shutdownNow` to true, sends a logout request, closes the socket, shuts down the P2P manager, and adds a quit message to the message box.

The code provided is for a class called `PriceTag` in the Brick-Force project. This class represents a price tag for a particular item or option in the game. It contains various properties and methods to handle the pricing and availability of the item.

The `PriceTag` class has several private variables, including `option`, `point`, `cash`, `cashBack`, `brick`, `pointDiscount`, `brickDiscount`, `cashDiscount`, `dscntStart`, `dscntEnd`, `vsblStart`, and `vsblEnd`. These variables store information about the pricing and availability of the item.

The class has several public properties that provide access to these private variables. For example, the `IsVisible` property returns a boolean value indicating whether the item is currently visible or not. The `IsDiscount` property returns a boolean value indicating whether the item is currently on discount or not. The `Point`, `Cash`, and `Brick` properties return the respective prices of the item, taking into account any discounts that may be applicable.

The class also has several methods to check if the item can be purchased. The `CanBuy` method takes a parameter `buyHow` of type `Good.BUY_HOW` and returns a boolean value indicating whether the item can be purchased using the specified method. There is an overloaded version of this method that takes an additional `rebuy` parameter, which is used to check if the item can be repurchased.

The `OnEverySec` method is called periodically and updates the start and end times for discounts and visibility of the item.

The `GetOptionString` method returns a string representation of the item's options, including the remaining quantity and the unit of measurement. The `GetRemainString` method returns a string representation of the remaining quantity of the item.

The `GetPriceString` method returns a string representation of the price of the item, taking into account any discounts. The `GetPrice` method returns the price of the item, taking into account any discounts and a specified percentage.

Overall, the `PriceTag` class provides functionality to handle the pricing, availability, and purchasing of items in the Brick-Force game. It allows for checking if an item can be purchased, getting the price and remaining quantity of an item, and handling discounts and visibility.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `PriceTag` class?
   - **Answer:** The `PriceTag` class represents a price tag for a specific item or option, and it contains information about the original price, discounts, visibility, and availability for purchase.

2. **Question:** How does the `CanBuy` method determine if an item can be purchased?
   - **Answer:** The `CanBuy` method checks the `IsVisible` property and the quantity of the item (Point, Brick, or Cash) to determine if it is available for purchase. It also checks if the `option` value is less than 1000000 when the `rebuy` parameter is true.

3. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `GetOptionString` method?
   - **Answer:** The `GetOptionString` method returns a string representation of the remaining quantity of an item (Point, Brick, or Cash) after applying a discount percentage. It also includes the unit of measurement (e.g., "POINT", "BRICK_POINT", or the token string).

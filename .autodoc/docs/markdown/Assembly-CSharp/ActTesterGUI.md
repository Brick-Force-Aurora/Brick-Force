The code provided is a script called "ActTesterGUI" that is used for testing and demonstrating the functionality of various anti-cheat measures in the Brick-Force project. 

The script is attached to a GameObject in the Unity game engine and is responsible for creating a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows the user to interact with different anti-cheat features. 

The script contains several private variables, including "savesAlterationDetected", "savesLock", and "foreignSavesDetected", which are used to track the state of the anti-cheat measures. 

The script also contains references to several other scripts, such as "ObscuredVector3Test", "ObscuredFloatTest", "ObscuredIntTest", "ObscuredStringTest", and "ObscuredPrefsTest". These scripts likely contain the actual anti-cheat logic and are used to test different types of data (e.g., vectors, floats, ints, strings) for cheating attempts. 

The "Awake" method is called when the script is initialized and is responsible for setting up event handlers for detecting alterations and foreign saves. It also finds an instance of the "DetectorsUsageExample" script, which is used to detect speed hacks and injections. 

The "OnGUI" method is called every frame and is responsible for rendering the GUI elements. It creates a horizontal layout group and two vertical layout groups. The first vertical group contains buttons and labels for testing the anti-cheat measures related to memory cheating protection, such as obscured strings, ints, floats, and vectors. The second vertical group contains buttons and labels for testing the anti-cheat measures related to saves cheating protection using ObscuredPrefs. 

The "CenteredLabel" method is a helper method that creates a centered label in the GUI. 

Overall, this script provides a user interface for testing and demonstrating the functionality of various anti-cheat measures in the Brick-Force project. It allows the user to interact with different types of data and see the effects of cheating attempts.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the ObscuredTypes namespace?**
The ObscuredTypes namespace is likely used to provide additional security measures for sensitive data types, such as Vector3, float, int, and string, to prevent cheating or unauthorized access.

2. **What is the purpose of the DetectorsUsageExample class and how is it related to the ActTesterGUI class?**
The DetectorsUsageExample class is likely used to detect cheating or unauthorized actions in the game. It is related to the ActTesterGUI class because the ActTesterGUI class displays the results of the cheating detection performed by the DetectorsUsageExample class.

3. **What is the purpose of the Awake() method and what does it do?**
The Awake() method is called when the script instance is being loaded. In this code, it assigns the SavesAlterationDetected and ForeignSavesDetected methods to the ObscuredPrefs.onAlterationDetected and ObscuredPrefs.onPossibleForeignSavesDetected events respectively. It also finds an instance of the DetectorsUsageExample class and assigns it to the detectorsUsageExample variable.

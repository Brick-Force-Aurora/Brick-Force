  "summary": "The code provided is a class called `DurabilityEvent` that represents an event related to the durability of an item in the game. This class is likely used in the larger Brick-Force project to handle events related to the durability of weapons or other items.\n\nThe `DurabilityEvent` class has three public properties: `code`, `durability`, and `diff`. These properties represent the code or identifier of the item, the current durability of the item, and the difference in durability from the previous state, respectively.\n\nThe class also has a constructor that takes in these three properties and assigns them to the corresponding fields. This allows for easy initialization of a `DurabilityEvent` object with the necessary information.\n\nThe most important method in this class is the `ToString()` method, which overrides the base `ToString()` method. This method is responsible for generating a string representation of the `DurabilityEvent` object. It does this by retrieving the corresponding `TWeapon` object from the `TItemManager` using the `code` property. If the `TWeapon` object is not found, an empty string is returned.\n\nIf the `TWeapon` object is found, the method determines whether the `diff` property is less than or equal to 0. If it is, the key \"REPAIR_EVENT\" is used; otherwise, the key \"DECAY_EVENT\" is used. These keys are likely used to retrieve localized strings for displaying the event type.\n\nThe method then calculates the percentage of the current durability and the absolute value of the difference in durability relative to the maximum durability of the weapon. These percentages are then used to format a string using the `StringMgr` class, which likely handles localization and string formatting.\n\nOverall, this code provides a way to represent and generate a string representation of durability events for items in the game. It is likely used in the larger Brick-Force project to handle and display events related to the durability of weapons or other items.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the DurabilityEvent class?\n- The DurabilityEvent class is used to represent an event related to the durability of a weapon in the game.\n\n2. What parameters are required to create a DurabilityEvent object?\n- To create a DurabilityEvent object, the code (string), durability (int), and diff (int) parameters are required.\n\n3. What does the ToString() method of the DurabilityEvent class do?\n- The ToString() method calculates and returns a formatted string that represents the event, including the name of the weapon, the current durability percentage, and the change in durability percentage."

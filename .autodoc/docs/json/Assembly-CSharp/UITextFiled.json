  "summary": "The code provided is a class called `UITextFiled` that extends the `UIBase` class. This class is used to create a text input field in a user interface (UI) for the larger Brick-Force project.\n\nThe `UITextFiled` class has several properties and methods that control the behavior and functionality of the text input field. \n\nThe `area` property is a `Vector2` that represents the size of the text input field in the UI. \n\nThe `controlName` property is a string that represents the name of the text input field control. This is used to identify the control in the UI and can be set by the user. If the `controlName` is not set, an error message is logged.\n\nThe `maxTextLength` property is an integer that represents the maximum number of characters allowed in the text input field. If the input text exceeds this limit, it is truncated.\n\nThe `deleteSpace` property is a boolean that determines whether spaces should be deleted from the input text. If set to `true`, spaces are removed from the input text.\n\nThe `inputText` property is a string that holds the current text entered in the input field.\n\nThe `Draw` method is an override of the `Draw` method from the `UIBase` class. It is responsible for rendering the text input field in the UI. It first checks if the field should be drawn by checking the `isDraw` property. If it is not set to `true`, the method returns `false`. Otherwise, it sets the control name using `GUI.SetNextControlName` and renders the text input field using `GUI.TextField`. If the input text exceeds the maximum length, it reverts the text back to the previous value.\n\nThe `GetInputText` method is used to retrieve the current input text. It removes tabs and newlines from the text and deletes spaces if the `deleteSpace` property is set to `true`.\n\nThe `ResetText` method is used to reset the input text to an empty string.\n\nOverall, this code provides a reusable class for creating and managing text input fields in the Brick-Force project's UI. Developers can use this class to easily add text input functionality to their UI elements.",
  "questions": "1. **What is the purpose of the `UITextFiled` class?**\nThe `UITextFiled` class is a subclass of `UIBase` and is used to create a text field UI element in the game.\n\n2. **What does the `Draw` method do?**\nThe `Draw` method is responsible for rendering the text field UI element on the screen. It returns a boolean value indicating whether the element was successfully drawn.\n\n3. **What does the `GetInputText` method do?**\nThe `GetInputText` method returns the current input text of the text field, after performing some string replacements to remove tabs, newlines, and spaces if specified."

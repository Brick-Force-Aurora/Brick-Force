  "summary": "The `Briefing4Bnd` class is a script that is part of the Brick-Force project. It is responsible for managing the briefing screen in the game. The purpose of this code is to handle the user interface and functionality of the briefing screen, allowing players to interact with various elements such as the chat, equipment, shop, and messenger.\n\nThe code starts by declaring several variables, including references to various game objects and textures used in the briefing screen. It also defines the positions and sizes of different UI elements on the screen.\n\nThe `Start` method is called when the script is first initialized. It sets up the initial state of the briefing screen by calling various methods to initialize different components such as the lobby chat, mirror, equipment frame, shop frame, and messenger. It also sets the mirror type to \"simple\" and sends a network request to resume the room if the player is the room master.\n\nThe `DrawCurrentChannel` method is responsible for displaying the name of the current channel on the screen.\n\nThe `OnGUI` method is called every frame to handle the rendering of the UI elements on the screen. It first sets up the GUI skin and enables or disables certain UI elements based on the current state of the game. It then draws various UI elements such as buttons, labels, and textures based on the current step of the briefing screen. The method also handles button clicks and toggles the messenger view on or off.\n\nThe `Update` method is called every frame to update the state of the briefing screen. It updates various components such as the lobby chat, messenger, mirror, channel label, equipment frame, shop frame, and briefing panel. It also checks if a certain amount of time has passed and if the player has been exiled from their clan.\n\nThe `OnClanExiled` method is called when the player has been exiled from their clan. It displays a message to the player and performs some cleanup by closing dialogs and sending network requests to leave the squad and clear the squad manager.\n\nOverall, this code manages the briefing screen in the Brick-Force game, allowing players to interact with various elements and providing a smooth user experience.",

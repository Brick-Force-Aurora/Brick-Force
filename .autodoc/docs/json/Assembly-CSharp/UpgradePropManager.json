  "summary": "The `UpgradePropManager` class is responsible for managing the upgrade properties of a game object in the larger Brick-Force project. \n\nThe purpose of this code is to load and parse a CSV file containing upgrade properties for different categories of game objects. The loaded data is stored in the `upgradeCatTable` array, which is an array of `UpgradeCategoryPropTable` objects. Each `UpgradeCategoryPropTable` object represents a category of game objects and contains an array of boolean values representing the upgrade properties for that category.\n\nThe code provides a singleton pattern implementation through the `Instance` property, which ensures that only one instance of the `UpgradePropManager` class is created and accessed throughout the project. This allows other parts of the project to easily access the upgrade properties.\n\nThe `LoadAll` method is responsible for loading the upgrade properties. It first checks if the game is running in a web player environment or not. If it is, it starts a coroutine `LoadAllFromWWW` to load the properties from a web server. Otherwise, it calls the `LoadUpgradePropTableFromLocalFileSystem` method to load the properties from the local file system.\n\nThe `LoadAllFromWWW` method uses a `WWW` object to download the upgrade properties CSV file from a specified URL. It then uses a `CSVLoader` object to parse the downloaded data and populate the `upgradeCatTable` array.\n\nThe `LoadUpgradePropTableFromLocalFileSystem` method loads the upgrade properties CSV file from the local file system using a `CSVLoader` object. If the file is not found or fails to load, it logs an error message. If the file is successfully loaded, it saves a secured version of the file and then calls the `ParseUpgradePropTable` method to populate the `upgradeCatTable` array.\n\nThe `UseProp` method is a utility method that takes a category index and a property index as parameters and returns the corresponding upgrade property value from the `upgradeCatTable` array.\n\nOverall, this code provides a way to load and manage upgrade properties for different categories of game objects in the Brick-Force project. Other parts of the project can use the `UpgradePropManager.Instance` property to access and use these upgrade properties.",
  "questions": "**Question 1:** What is the purpose of the `UpgradePropManager` class?\n    \n**Answer:** The `UpgradePropManager` class is responsible for managing upgrade properties in the game.\n\n**Question 2:** How does the `LoadAll` method determine whether to load upgrade properties from the web or from the local file system?\n    \n**Answer:** The `LoadAll` method checks the `isWebPlayer` property of the `Property` class from the `BuildOption.Instance.Props` instance to determine whether to load from the web or from the local file system.\n\n**Question 3:** What is the purpose of the `UseProp` method and how does it determine which upgrade property to use?\n    \n**Answer:** The `UseProp` method returns a boolean value indicating whether a specific upgrade property should be used. It determines which upgrade property to use based on the `cat` and `prop` parameters, which are used as indices to access the `props` array in the `upgradeCatTable`."

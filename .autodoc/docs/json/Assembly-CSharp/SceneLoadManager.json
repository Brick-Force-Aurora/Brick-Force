  "summary": "The code provided is for a class called `SceneLoadManager` in the Brick-Force project. This class is responsible for managing the loading of scenes in the game. It contains methods and properties that allow for asynchronous loading of scenes and provide information about the loading progress.\n\nThe `SceneLoadManager` class has a public `autoFunctionMap` dictionary that maps integers to `SceneLoadManager` instances. This dictionary is not used in the provided code and its purpose is unclear.\n\nThe class also has a private static `_instance` variable, which is used to implement the Singleton design pattern. The `Instance` property is a getter that returns the `_instance` variable. If `_instance` is null, it tries to find an existing `SceneLoadManager` instance in the scene using `Object.FindObjectOfType`. If no instance is found, it logs an error message. This ensures that there is only one instance of `SceneLoadManager` in the game.\n\nThe `Awake` method is called when the script instance is being loaded. It uses `Object.DontDestroyOnLoad` to prevent the `SceneLoadManager` object from being destroyed when a new scene is loaded. This ensures that the `SceneLoadManager` persists throughout the game.\n\nThe `Update` method is empty and does not contain any code. It is not used in the provided code.\n\nThe `SceneLoadLevelAsync` method is a public method that starts the asynchronous loading of a scene. It takes a `level` parameter, which is the name of the scene to be loaded. It starts a coroutine called `LoadLevelAsync` with the `level` parameter.\n\nThe `LoadLevelAsync` coroutine is a private method that performs the actual asynchronous loading of the scene. It sets the `levelName` variable to the provided `level` parameter and uses `Application.LoadLevelAsync` to load the scene asynchronously. It yields the `async` operation, which means it waits for the loading to complete before continuing.\n\nThe `IsLoadedDone` method checks if the loading is done by checking if the `async` variable is not null and if `async.isDone` is true. If both conditions are met, it returns true, indicating that the loading is done.\n\nThe `IsLoadStart` method checks if the loading has started for a specific level. It takes a `level` parameter and compares it to the `levelName` variable. If they are equal, it returns true, indicating that the loading has started for that level.\n\nThe `GetProgressString` method returns a string representing the loading progress. If `async` is null, it returns \"Load Ready\". If `async.isDone` is true, it returns \"Load Complete\". Otherwise, it returns the loading progress as a percentage.\n\nOverall, the `SceneLoadManager` class provides a way to asynchronously load scenes in the game and retrieve information about the loading progress. It ensures that there is only one instance of the `SceneLoadManager` in the game and persists throughout the game.",

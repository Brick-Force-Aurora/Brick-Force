  "summary": "The code provided is a class called \"BungeeTools\" that is a part of the larger Brick-Force project. This class is responsible for managing and controlling the bungee tools in the game. \n\nThe class contains several constants, such as RESERVE_SLOT, ITEM_SLOT, ITEM_USE, and ITEM_CHANGE, which are used as indices for various operations related to the bungee tools. \n\nThe class also has an array of strings called \"input\" that stores the names of the input keys for the bungee tools. These input keys are used to trigger specific actions related to the bungee tools. \n\nThe class has a reference to the \"BungeeTool\" class, which represents an individual bungee tool. The \"tools\" array stores instances of the \"BungeeTool\" class. \n\nThe class also has references to various UI elements, such as \"itemBackground\" and \"keyTextBackground\", which are used to display the bungee tools and their associated key bindings on the screen. \n\nThe class has a method called \"StartCoolTime()\" that starts the cooldown time for all the bungee tools. This method iterates over the \"tools\" array and calls the \"StartCoolTime()\" method on each individual bungee tool. \n\nThe class also has an \"OnGUI()\" method that is responsible for rendering the bungee tools and their associated UI elements on the screen. This method is called by the Unity engine during the GUI rendering phase. \n\nThe class has an \"Update()\" method that is called by the Unity engine every frame. This method is responsible for updating the state of the bungee tools and handling user input related to the bungee tools. \n\nThe class has several other helper methods, such as \"VerifyLocalController()\", \"AddActiveItem()\", and \"ResetAllSlot()\", which are used for various operations related to the bungee tools. \n\nOverall, the \"BungeeTools\" class is an important component of the Brick-Force project as it manages and controls the bungee tools in the game. It handles user input, updates the state of the bungee tools, and renders the bungee tools on the screen.",

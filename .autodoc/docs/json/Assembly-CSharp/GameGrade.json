  "summary": "The `GameGrade` class in the Brick-Force project is responsible for displaying a grade texture on the screen for a certain period of time. \n\nThe class has several private variables, including `texGrade`, which is a Texture2D object representing the grade texture to be displayed, and `crdBg`, which is a Rect object representing the position and size of the grade texture on the screen. \n\nThere are also several float variables, such as `delta` and `maxDelta`, which are used to keep track of the time elapsed since the grade texture was last shown, and the maximum time interval between showing the grade texture. \n\nThe class also has a boolean variable `showPic`, which determines whether the grade texture should be shown or not. \n\nThe class has a static instance variable `_instance` and a static property `Instance` that allows other classes to access the `GameGrade` instance. \n\nThe `Awake` method is called when the object is initialized and it ensures that the `GameGrade` object is not destroyed when a new scene is loaded. \n\nThe `OnGUI` method is responsible for drawing the grade texture on the screen. It checks if the game is being played in a specific mode (Netmarble or Developer) and then calls the `TextureUtil.DrawTexture` method to draw the grade texture on the screen. \n\nThe `Update` method is called every frame and it updates the `delta` variable with the time elapsed since the last frame. If the elapsed time exceeds the `maxDelta` value, the `showPic` variable is set to true, indicating that the grade texture should be shown. The `deltaShow` variable is also updated to keep track of the time the grade texture has been shown. If the elapsed time exceeds the `maxDeltaShow` value, the `showPic` variable is set to false, indicating that the grade texture should no longer be shown. \n\nOverall, the purpose of this code is to display a grade texture on the screen for a certain period of time, based on the elapsed time and specified intervals. This functionality can be used in the larger Brick-Force project to provide visual feedback or rewards to the player based on their performance or progress in the game.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `GameGrade` class?\n- The purpose of the `GameGrade` class is not clear from the provided code. It seems to handle GUI elements related to game grading, but more information is needed to determine its exact purpose.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `maxDelta` and `maxDeltaShow` variables?\n- The `maxDelta` variable determines the maximum value that the `delta` variable can reach before it is reset to 0. The `maxDeltaShow` variable determines the maximum value that the `deltaShow` variable can reach before the `showPic` variable is set to false.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `OnGUI` method?\n- The `OnGUI` method is responsible for rendering GUI elements related to game grading. It checks if the game is being built for Netmarble or in developer mode before rendering the GUI elements."

  "summary": "The code provided is a part of the Brick-Force project and is a script for a projectile called \"PrjSmoke\". This script is responsible for the behavior and functionality of the smoke projectile in the game.\n\nThe `Start()` method is called when the projectile is instantiated. It checks a build option flag called `useUskWeaponTex` from the `BuildOption` class. If this flag is true, it retrieves all the `MeshRenderer` components attached to the projectile and iterates through them. For each `MeshRenderer`, it checks if the main texture of the material is not null and if the texture name exists in the `UskManager` instance. If both conditions are met, it replaces the main texture with the corresponding texture from the `UskManager`.\n\nThe `Update()` method is called every frame. It first checks if the projectile has a `Rigidbody` component and if it is not kinematic. If these conditions are met, it updates the `deltaTime` variable with the time since the last frame and increments the `DetonatorTime` variable by the same amount. If the `DetonatorTime` exceeds a predefined `explosionTime`, it instantiates an explosion object at the projectile's position and destroys the projectile object. Before instantiating the explosion, it modifies the energy values of any `ParticleEmitter` components attached to the explosion object by adding the `PersistTime` value from the base class.\n\nIf the `DetonatorTime` is not greater than the `explosionTime`, it checks if the `deltaTime` is greater than the `SendRate` value from the `BuildOption` class. If it is, it resets the `deltaTime` to 0 and sends a network message using the `P2PManager` class to inform other players about the projectile's position and rotation.\n\nThe `FixedUpdate()` method is called at a fixed interval and is responsible for applying a torque force to the projectile's `Rigidbody` component. It adds a torque force in the direction of the right vector multiplied by a constant value of 1000f.\n\nOverall, this script handles the initialization, movement, detonation, and network synchronization of the smoke projectile in the Brick-Force game.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `Start()` method in the `PrjSmoke` class?\n- The `Start()` method is used to check if a specific build option is enabled and modify the main texture of the mesh renderers accordingly.\n\n2. What does the `Update()` method in the `PrjSmoke` class do?\n- The `Update()` method is responsible for handling the detonation and destruction of the projectile, as well as sending network messages related to the projectile's movement.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `FixedUpdate()` method in the `PrjSmoke` class?\n- The `FixedUpdate()` method is used to apply a torque force to the projectile's rigidbody component, causing it to rotate around the right axis."

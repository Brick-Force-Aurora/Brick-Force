  "summary": "The code provided defines a class called `Infection`. This class represents an infection event in the larger Brick-Force project. \n\nThe `Infection` class has two private integer variables: `host` and `newZombie`. These variables store the IDs of the host and the newly infected zombie, respectively. \n\nThe class also has two public properties: `Host` and `NewZombie`. These properties provide read-only access to the private variables `host` and `newZombie`, respectively. This means that other parts of the code can retrieve the values of these variables but cannot modify them directly. \n\nThe `Infection` class has a constructor that takes two integer parameters: `_host` and `_newZombie`. These parameters are used to initialize the `host` and `newZombie` variables. \n\nThe purpose of this code is to represent an infection event in the Brick-Force project. It provides a way to store and retrieve information about the host and the newly infected zombie. \n\nHere's an example of how this code might be used in the larger project:\n\n```csharp\n// Create a new infection event\nInfection infection = new Infection(123, 456);\n\n// Retrieve the host and new zombie IDs\nint hostID = infection.Host;\nint newZombieID = infection.NewZombie;\n\n// Print the IDs\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Host ID: \" + hostID);\nConsole.WriteLine(\"New Zombie ID: \" + newZombieID);\n```\n\nIn this example, we create a new `Infection` object with the host ID of 123 and the new zombie ID of 456. We then retrieve these IDs using the `Host` and `NewZombie` properties and print them to the console. This allows us to track and display information about infection events in the Brick-Force project.",
  "questions": "1. **What is the purpose of the `Infection` class?**\nThe `Infection` class represents an infection event in the Brick-Force project, where a host becomes a new zombie. \n\n2. **What are the meanings of the `host` and `newZombie` variables?**\nThe `host` variable represents the original host before infection, while the `newZombie` variable represents the new zombie that resulted from the infection.\n\n3. **What is the significance of the `Host` and `NewZombie` properties?**\nThe `Host` and `NewZombie` properties provide read-only access to the `host` and `newZombie` variables respectively, allowing other parts of the code to retrieve their values."

  "summary": "The code provided is a class called \"UserMenu\" that extends the \"Dialog\" class. This class is responsible for displaying a user menu dialog in the game. The user menu dialog provides various options and actions that can be performed on a specific user.\n\nThe class has several private variables, including \"target\" which represents the user's ID, \"targetNickname\" which represents the user's nickname, \"isClanInvitable\" which indicates whether the user can be invited to a clan, \"isMasterAssign\" which indicates whether the user can be assigned as a master, and \"crdBtnBase\" which represents the base position and size of the buttons in the dialog.\n\nThe class has a public \"offset\" variable that determines the vertical spacing between buttons in the dialog.\n\nThe class overrides the \"Start\" method from the base \"Dialog\" class, where it sets the ID of the dialog to \"USER_MENU\".\n\nThe class also overrides the \"DoDialog\" method from the base \"Dialog\" class, which is responsible for rendering and handling user interactions with the dialog. The method first checks if the target user is valid and not the current user. If so, it returns true, indicating that the dialog should be closed.\n\nThe method then proceeds to render the buttons in the dialog based on various conditions and user permissions. For example, if the user is in a room, it displays an \"INVITE_MENU\" button that sends an invitation to the target user. If the user is not in a room, it displays a \"JOIN_MENU\" button that sends a following request to the target user.\n\nThe method also displays buttons for adding/removing the target user as a friend or banning/unbanning the target user. These buttons are only displayed if the target user is not already a friend or banned.\n\nAdditionally, if the current user is a clan staff member and the target user can be invited to a clan, a \"CLAN_INVITATION\" button is displayed. If the target user can be assigned as a master, a \"MASTER_ASSIGN\" button is displayed.\n\nThe method also displays a \"WHISPER\" button that allows the user to send a private message to the target user. It also displays a \"SEND_MEMO\" button that opens a memo dialog for the user to send a memo to the target user.\n\nFinally, the method displays a \"REPORT_GM_TITLE_01\" button if the game's build options allow it. This button opens an accusation dialog to report the target user to a game master.\n\nThe class also includes a private method called \"RecalcButtonWidth\" that calculates the width of the buttons based on their text content. This method is called during the initialization of the dialog to ensure that the buttons have appropriate widths.\n\nThe class also overrides the \"OnPopup\" method from the base \"Dialog\" class, where it sets the position of the dialog based on the screen size.\n\nThe class includes a public method called \"InitDialog\" that initializes the dialog with the target user's information and recalculates the button widths. This method is called before displaying the dialog.\n\nIn summary, the \"UserMenu\" class is responsible for rendering and handling user interactions with a user menu dialog in the game. The dialog provides various options and actions that can be performed on a specific user, such as inviting them to a room, adding/removing them as a friend, banning/unbanning them, sending private messages, and more. The class ensures that the dialog is displayed correctly and handles the corresponding actions when the user interacts with the buttons.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `UserMenu` class?\n- The `UserMenu` class is a subclass of `Dialog` and represents a user menu dialog in the game.\n\n2. What are the conditions for displaying the different buttons in the `DoDialog` method?\n- The buttons displayed depend on the value of `target`, whether the current room info is available, and whether the target is a friend or banned.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `RecalcButtonWidth` method?\n- The `RecalcButtonWidth` method calculates the width of the buttons based on the text content and adjusts the `crdBtnBase` width accordingly."

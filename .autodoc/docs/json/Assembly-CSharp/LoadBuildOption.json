  "summary": "The code provided is a part of the Brick-Force project and is contained in a file called \"LoadBuildOption\". This code is written in C# and utilizes the Unity game engine.\n\nThe purpose of this code is to handle the loading of a build option in the game. It is attached to a game object in the scene and is responsible for instantiating the build option object when the game starts. The build option object is specified by the \"buildOption\" variable, which is a reference to a prefab in the Unity editor.\n\nIn the Start() method, the code uses the Object.Instantiate() method to create an instance of the build option object. This method takes the build option prefab as a parameter and returns a reference to the instantiated object. This allows the build option to be displayed in the game when it starts.\n\nIn the Update() method, the code checks if the scene has not yet changed and if the \"Bootstrap\" scene can be loaded and is not already being loaded. If these conditions are met, the code calls the SceneLoadManager.Instance.SceneLoadLevelAsync() method to asynchronously load the \"Bootstrap\" scene. This method takes the scene name as a parameter and starts loading the scene in the background. The code also sets the \"isChangeScene\" variable to true to prevent the scene from being loaded multiple times.\n\nThis code is likely used in the larger Brick-Force project to handle the initial loading of the game and to display the build option to the player. The build option object could be a menu or a selection screen where the player can choose different options before starting the game. By loading the \"Bootstrap\" scene asynchronously, the game can continue to run smoothly while the scene is being loaded in the background.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```csharp\n// Attach the LoadBuildOption script to a game object in the scene\nGameObject loadBuildOptionObject = new GameObject(\"LoadBuildOption\");\nLoadBuildOption loadBuildOption = loadBuildOptionObject.AddComponent<LoadBuildOption>();\n\n// Set the build option prefab in the Unity editor\nloadBuildOption.buildOption = buildOptionPrefab;\n```",
  "questions": "1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `LoadBuildOption` class?\n   - **Answer:** The `LoadBuildOption` class is responsible for instantiating a `buildOption` GameObject and changing the scene to \"Bootstrap\" under certain conditions.\n\n2. **Question:** What is the significance of the `isChangeScene` variable?\n   - **Answer:** The `isChangeScene` variable is used to ensure that the scene is only changed once. It prevents multiple scene changes from occurring.\n\n3. **Question:** What is the role of the `SceneLoadManager` class and its methods?\n   - **Answer:** The `SceneLoadManager` class is responsible for managing scene loading. The `SceneLoadLevelAsync` method is used to load the \"Bootstrap\" scene asynchronously, while the `IsLoadStart` method checks if the scene loading process has started for the \"Bootstrap\" scene."

  "summary": "The code provided is a script called \"ExplosionMatchScore\" that is part of the Brick-Force project. This script is responsible for displaying the scores and other information related to a match in the game.\n\nThe script contains several public variables that can be set in the Unity editor. These variables include the GUI depth, fonts for the red and blue team scores, a font for the goal count, and a background texture for the score display. There are also several Vector2 variables that determine the position of the score elements on the screen.\n\nThe script has two private variables, redTeamScore and blueTeamScore, which store the current scores for the red and blue teams, respectively.\n\nThe Start() method is called when the script is first initialized. It sets the initial values for the redTeamScore and blueTeamScore variables to 0. It also checks if the player is currently in the \"BreakingInto\" mode and if so, sends a score request to the CSNetManager.\n\nThe OnTeamScore() method is called when the scores for the red and blue teams are updated. It compares the new scores with the current scores and updates the redScoreFont and blueScoreFont fonts accordingly. The Scale property of these fonts is set to 2f, which likely means that the font size is increased to make the score stand out.\n\nThe OnGUI() method is responsible for drawing the score display on the screen. It first checks if the GUI is enabled and if so, sets the GUI skin and depth. It then begins a GUI group with a rectangle that determines the position and size of the score display. The score background texture is drawn using the DrawTexture() method from the TextureUtil class. Depending on whether the player is on the red or blue team, the flickerRed or flickerBlue effect is drawn. The red and blue team scores are printed using the redScoreFont and blueScoreFont fonts, respectively. The goal count is printed using the goalFont font. Finally, the GUI group is ended and the GUI skin is reset.\n\nThe Update() method is called every frame and updates the flickerRed and flickerBlue effects.\n\nIn summary, this script is responsible for displaying the scores and other information related to a match in the game. It sets the initial scores, updates the scores when they change, and draws the score display on the screen.",

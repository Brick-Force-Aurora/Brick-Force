  "summary": "The code provided is a struct called `ObscuredVector3` that is used to encrypt and decrypt Vector3 values. It is part of a larger project called Brick-Force, which likely involves some form of game development using the Unity game engine.\n\nThe purpose of this code is to provide a way to store Vector3 values in an encrypted format, making it more difficult for players to cheat or manipulate the values. It achieves this by using a cryptographic key to encrypt and decrypt the values.\n\nThe struct has several properties (`x`, `y`, `z`) that allow access to the individual components of the Vector3 value. These properties use the `InternalDecryptField` method to decrypt the hidden value and check for cheating. If cheating is detected (i.e., the decrypted value does not match the fake value), the `onCheatingDetected` action is invoked.\n\nThe struct also has an indexer that allows access to the Vector3 components using an index. This indexer uses the same decryption and cheating detection logic as the individual properties.\n\nThe struct provides methods to set a new crypto key (`SetNewCryptoKey`), get the encrypted value (`GetEncrypted`), and set the encrypted value (`SetEncrypted`). These methods use the `InternalDecrypt` and `Encrypt` methods to perform the encryption and decryption operations.\n\nThe `Encrypt` and `Decrypt` methods are used internally to encrypt and decrypt Vector3 values. They use the `ObscuredDouble` class to perform the encryption and decryption operations on each component of the Vector3 value.\n\nThe struct also overrides the `GetHashCode`, `ToString`, and `ToString(string format)` methods to provide the decrypted value's hash code and string representations.\n\nLastly, the struct provides implicit conversion operators to convert between `ObscuredVector3` and `Vector3` types. These operators use the encryption and decryption methods to perform the conversion.\n\nOverall, this code provides a way to store Vector3 values in an encrypted format, making it more difficult for players to cheat or manipulate the values in the Brick-Force project.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `ObscuredVector3` struct?\n- The `ObscuredVector3` struct is used to store and manipulate encrypted Vector3 values.\n\n2. How does the encryption and decryption process work for the `ObscuredVector3` struct?\n- The encryption process involves encrypting each component of the Vector3 using the `ObscuredDouble.Encrypt` method. The decryption process involves decrypting each component of the encrypted Vector3 using the `ObscuredDouble.Decrypt` method.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `onCheatingDetected` action and when is it triggered?\n- The `onCheatingDetected` action is triggered when cheating is detected. It is triggered if the `fakeValue` is not equal to a Vector3 with all components set to 0 and the difference between the decrypted value and the `fakeValue` is greater than 0.0005f."

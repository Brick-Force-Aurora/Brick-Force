  "summary": "The code provided is a part of the Brick-Force project and it defines a struct called `ObscuredBool` in the `CodeStage.AntiCheat.ObscuredTypes` namespace. This struct is used to store and manipulate boolean values in an obscured manner, making it harder for cheaters to modify the values.\n\nThe `ObscuredBool` struct has several private fields:\n- `cryptoKey`: a static byte variable that holds the encryption key used to encrypt and decrypt the boolean values.\n- `currentCryptoKey`: a byte variable that holds the current encryption key used for the struct instance.\n- `hiddenValue`: an integer variable that holds the encrypted value of the boolean.\n- `fakeValue`: a nullable boolean variable that holds the original value of the boolean if cheating is detected.\n- `inited`: a boolean variable that indicates whether the struct instance has been initialized.\n\nThe struct also has a static `Action` delegate called `onCheatingDetected`, which can be assigned a method to be called when cheating is detected.\n\nThe struct provides several methods and operators to manipulate the boolean values:\n- `SetNewCryptoKey(byte newKey)`: a static method that allows changing the encryption key.\n- `GetEncrypted()`: a method that returns the encrypted value of the boolean.\n- `SetEncrypted(int encrypted)`: a method that sets the encrypted value of the boolean.\n- `Encrypt(bool value)`: a static method that encrypts a boolean value using the current encryption key.\n- `Decrypt(int value)`: a static method that decrypts an encrypted value using the current encryption key.\n- `InternalDecrypt()`: a private method that decrypts the encrypted value and checks for cheating.\n- `Equals(object obj)`: an overridden method that compares the hidden values of two `ObscuredBool` instances.\n- `Equals(ObscuredBool obj)`: a method that compares the hidden values of two `ObscuredBool` instances.\n- `GetHashCode()`: an overridden method that returns the hash code of the decrypted value.\n- `ToString()`: an overridden method that returns the string representation of the decrypted value.\n- `implicit operator ObscuredBool(bool value)`: an implicit conversion operator that creates a new `ObscuredBool` instance from a boolean value.\n- `implicit operator bool(ObscuredBool value)`: an implicit conversion operator that returns the decrypted value of an `ObscuredBool` instance.\n\nThe purpose of this code is to provide a way to store and manipulate boolean values in an obscured manner, making it harder for cheaters to modify the values. The encryption and decryption methods ensure that the boolean values are not easily readable or modifiable by external sources. The `onCheatingDetected` delegate allows for custom actions to be taken when cheating is detected, such as logging or banning the cheater.\n\nHere is an example of how this code can be used in the larger project:\n\n```csharp\nObscuredBool isCheating = true; // Create a new ObscuredBool instance and set it to true\n\n// Change the encryption key\nObscuredBool.SetNewCryptoKey(123);\n\n// Get the encrypted value\nint encryptedValue = isCheating.GetEncrypted();\n\n// Set the encrypted value\nisCheating.SetEncrypted(encryptedValue);\n\n// Check if the value is true\nif (isCheating)\n{\n    // Do something if the value is true\n}\n```\n\nOverall, this code provides a way to store and manipulate boolean values in an obscured manner, enhancing the security of the Brick-Force project and making it more difficult for cheaters to modify the values.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `ObscuredBool` struct?\n- The `ObscuredBool` struct is used to store and manipulate boolean values in an encrypted form.\n\n2. How does the encryption and decryption process work for `ObscuredBool`?\n- The encryption process involves XORing the boolean value with a crypto key, while the decryption process involves XORing the encrypted value with the same crypto key.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `onCheatingDetected` action?\n- The `onCheatingDetected` action is a callback that is triggered when a cheating attempt is detected."

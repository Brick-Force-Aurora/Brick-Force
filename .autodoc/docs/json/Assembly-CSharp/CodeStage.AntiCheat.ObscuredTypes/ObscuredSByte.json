  "summary": "The code provided is a part of the Brick-Force project and it defines a struct called `ObscuredSByte` in the `CodeStage.AntiCheat.ObscuredTypes` namespace. This struct is used to store and manipulate encrypted sbyte values.\n\nThe `ObscuredSByte` struct has several private fields:\n- `cryptoKey`: a static sbyte variable that represents the encryption key used to encrypt and decrypt the values.\n- `currentCryptoKey`: a sbyte variable that represents the current encryption key used for the instance of `ObscuredSByte`.\n- `hiddenValue`: a sbyte variable that stores the encrypted value.\n- `fakeValue`: a sbyte variable that stores the decrypted value for comparison in case of cheating detection.\n- `inited`: a boolean variable that indicates whether the struct has been initialized.\n\nThe struct also has a static `Action` delegate called `onCheatingDetected`, which can be used to handle cheating detection events.\n\nThe struct provides several methods and operators for encryption, decryption, and manipulation of the encrypted values:\n- `SetNewCryptoKey`: a static method that allows changing the encryption key.\n- `GetEncrypted`: a method that returns the decrypted value by decrypting the `hiddenValue` using the current encryption key.\n- `SetEncrypted`: a method that sets the `hiddenValue` to the provided encrypted value and updates the `fakeValue` if cheating is detected.\n- `EncryptDecrypt`: a static method that can be used to encrypt or decrypt a sbyte value using the specified encryption key.\n- `InternalDecrypt`: a private method that decrypts the `hiddenValue` using the current or default encryption key and handles cheating detection.\n\nThe struct also overrides several methods from the `Object` class:\n- `Equals`: overrides the `Equals` method to compare the `hiddenValue` of two `ObscuredSByte` instances.\n- `ToString`: overrides the `ToString` method to return the decrypted value as a string.\n- `GetHashCode`: overrides the `GetHashCode` method to return the hash code of the decrypted value.\n- `ToString(IFormatProvider)`: overrides the `ToString` method to return the decrypted value as a string using the specified format provider.\n- `ToString(string, IFormatProvider)`: overrides the `ToString` method to return the decrypted value as a string using the specified format and format provider.\n\nThe struct also provides implicit conversion operators to convert between `ObscuredSByte` and sbyte types.\n\nOverall, this code provides a way to store and manipulate encrypted sbyte values, with built-in cheating detection. It allows for secure storage and manipulation of sensitive data within the Brick-Force project.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `ObscuredSByte` struct?\n- The `ObscuredSByte` struct is used to store and manipulate a signed byte value in an encrypted and obscured manner.\n\n2. How does the encryption and decryption process work?\n- The encryption and decryption process is done using the `EncryptDecrypt` method, which performs a bitwise XOR operation on the value with a crypto key. The key can be set using the `SetNewCryptoKey` method.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `onCheatingDetected` action and how is it used?\n- The `onCheatingDetected` action is used to detect if the value has been tampered with. It is triggered when the `SetEncrypted` method is called and the decrypted value does not match the stored fake value."

  "summary": "The code provided is a class called `ObscuredString` that is part of the `CodeStage.AntiCheat.ObscuredTypes` namespace. This class is used to encrypt and decrypt strings using a specified crypto key. It provides methods to set and get the encrypted value, as well as methods to encrypt and decrypt strings.\n\nThe class has the following properties and fields:\n- `onCheatingDetected`: a static Action that can be assigned to a method to be called when cheating is detected.\n- `cryptoKey`: a static string that represents the default crypto key used for encryption and decryption.\n- `currentCryptoKey`: a string that represents the current crypto key used for encryption and decryption.\n- `hiddenValue`: a string that represents the encrypted value of the string.\n- `fakeValue`: a string that represents the decrypted value of the string, used for cheating detection.\n- `inited`: a boolean flag that indicates whether the class has been initialized.\n\nThe class has the following methods:\n- `SetNewCryptoKey(string newKey)`: a static method that sets a new crypto key to be used for encryption and decryption.\n- `GetEncrypted()`: a method that returns the encrypted value of the string.\n- `SetEncrypted(string encrypted)`: a method that sets the encrypted value of the string and checks for cheating by comparing the decrypted value with the fake value.\n- `EncryptDecrypt(string value)`: a static method that encrypts and decrypts a string using the default crypto key.\n- `EncryptDecrypt(string value, string key)`: a static method that encrypts and decrypts a string using a specified crypto key.\n- `InternalDecrypt()`: a private method that decrypts the hidden value using the current crypto key and checks for cheating by comparing the decrypted value with the fake value.\n- `ToString()`: an overridden method that returns the decrypted value of the string.\n- `Equals(object obj)`: an overridden method that compares the hidden value of the string with another obscured string.\n- `Equals(ObscuredString value)`: a method that compares the hidden value of the string with another obscured string.\n- `Equals(ObscuredString value, StringComparison comparisonType)`: a method that compares the decrypted value of the string with the decrypted value of another obscured string using a specified comparison type.\n- `GetHashCode()`: an overridden method that returns the hash code of the decrypted value of the string.\n- `implicit operator ObscuredString(string value)`: an implicit conversion operator that encrypts a string and returns an obscured string.\n- `implicit operator string(ObscuredString value)`: an implicit conversion operator that decrypts an obscured string and returns a string.\n- `operator ==(ObscuredString a, ObscuredString b)`: an operator overload that compares two obscured strings for equality.\n- `operator !=(ObscuredString a, ObscuredString b)`: an operator overload that compares two obscured strings for inequality.\n\nThis class can be used in the larger project to securely store and transmit sensitive strings, such as passwords or API keys. By encrypting the strings using a crypto key, the sensitive information is protected from unauthorized access. The class also provides methods for comparing obscured strings and detecting cheating by comparing the decrypted value with a fake value.",
  "questions": "1. **What is the purpose of the `ObscuredString` class?**\nThe `ObscuredString` class is used to encrypt and decrypt strings using a crypto key.\n\n2. **How does the encryption and decryption process work?**\nThe encryption and decryption process is done using the `EncryptDecrypt` method, which takes a string value and a key as parameters. It performs an XOR operation between each character of the value and the corresponding character of the key, and returns the result as an encrypted or decrypted string.\n\n3. **What is the purpose of the `onCheatingDetected` action?**\nThe `onCheatingDetected` action is a callback that is triggered when cheating is detected during the decryption process. It is called if the decrypted value is not equal to the fake value that was set during the encryption process."

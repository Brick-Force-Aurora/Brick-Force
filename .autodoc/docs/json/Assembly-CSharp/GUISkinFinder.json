  "summary": "The `GUISkinFinder` class is responsible for managing the GUI skin used in the Brick-Force project. A GUI skin is a collection of graphical styles and settings that define the appearance of GUI elements in the game.\n\nThe `GUISkinFinder` class has a public `guiSkin` variable of type `GUISkin`, which represents the GUI skin used in the project. This variable can be set in the Unity editor or through code.\n\nThe class also has a private static array `builtinGUIStyleNames` that contains the names of the built-in GUI styles provided by Unity. These styles include \"box\", \"button\", \"toggle\", \"label\", and others.\n\nThe class has a static property `Instance` that provides a singleton instance of the `GUISkinFinder` class. This ensures that there is only one instance of the class throughout the project. The instance is obtained by finding an object of type `GUISkinFinder` in the scene. If no instance is found, an error message is logged.\n\nThe `Awake` method is called when the object is initialized. It uses `Object.DontDestroyOnLoad` to prevent the object from being destroyed when a new scene is loaded.\n\nThe `UpdateFont` method is used to update the font used in the GUI skin. It takes a `Font` parameter `curFont` and sets the `font` property of the `guiSkin` to `curFont`. It also updates the font of all the GUI styles in the `guiSkin` and the built-in GUI styles.\n\nThe `GetGUISkin` method simply returns the `guiSkin` variable.\n\nThe `LanguageChanged` method is called when the language in the game is changed. It calls the `SetFont` method of the `LangOptManager` class to update the font used for language options. It then finds the \"Main\" object in the scene and sends a message to its \"OnLanguageChanged\" method.\n\nOverall, the `GUISkinFinder` class provides functionality to manage the GUI skin used in the Brick-Force project. It allows for updating the font used in the GUI skin and handles language changes in the game.",

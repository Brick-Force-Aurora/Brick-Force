  "summary": "The `InviteManager` class is a component in the Brick-Force project that manages a list of `Invite` objects. It provides methods to add, remove, and retrieve invite data.\n\nThe `InviteManager` class has a public list called `listInvite` which stores instances of the `Invite` class. This list is initially empty.\n\nThe class also has a private static instance variable `_instance` and a public static property `Instance`. The `Instance` property is a singleton pattern implementation that ensures only one instance of the `InviteManager` class is created. It uses the `Object.FindObjectOfType` method to find an existing instance of `InviteManager` in the scene or creates a new one if none exists. If the instance is not found or created, it logs an error message.\n\nThe `Awake` method is called when the `InviteManager` object is initialized. It uses `Object.DontDestroyOnLoad` to prevent the object from being destroyed when a new scene is loaded.\n\nThe `AddInvite` method takes an `Invite` object as a parameter and adds it to the `listInvite` list. It first calls the `Remove` method to remove any existing invite with the same `invitorSeq` value. Then it adds the new invite to the list. It also checks if an instance of the `InviteNoticeDialog` is already open and if so, it initializes the dialog.\n\nThe `Remove` method takes an integer `key` as a parameter and removes the invite with the matching `invitorSeq` value from the `listInvite` list. It iterates through the list and compares the `invitorSeq` value of each invite with the `key` value. If a match is found, it removes the invite from the list and exits the loop.\n\nThe `RemoveAll` method clears the `listInvite` list and stores the first invite in the list in the `savedForClan` variable.\n\nThe `GetData` method returns the value of the `savedForClan` variable.\n\nOverall, the `InviteManager` class provides functionality to manage a list of invites, add new invites, remove invites by key, and retrieve invite data. It also ensures that only one instance of the `InviteManager` class exists in the scene. This class can be used in the larger Brick-Force project to handle invite-related operations and manage invite data.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `InviteManager` class?\n- The `InviteManager` class is responsible for managing a list of invites and performing operations such as adding, removing, and retrieving invites.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `Instance` property?\n- The `Instance` property is a singleton pattern implementation that ensures there is only one instance of the `InviteManager` class throughout the application.\n\n3. What does the `RemoveAll` method do?\n- The `RemoveAll` method clears the list of invites and saves the first invite in the list to a variable called `savedForClan`."

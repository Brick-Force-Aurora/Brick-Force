  "summary": "The `SquadManager` class is responsible for managing squads and squad members in the larger Brick-Force project. It contains various methods and properties to handle squad-related operations.\n\nThe class has several private fields, including `dicSquad`, `squad`, `dicMember`, and `isMatching`. `dicSquad` is a dictionary that stores squads, where the key is an integer index and the value is an instance of the `Squad` class. `squad` is an integer that represents the current squad index. `dicMember` is a dictionary that stores squad members, where the key is an integer sequence and the value is an instance of the `NameCard` class. `isMatching` is a boolean flag that indicates whether the squad is currently in a matching process.\n\nThe class also has a private static field `_instance` and a public static property `Instance`. These are used to implement the singleton pattern, ensuring that there is only one instance of the `SquadManager` class throughout the project.\n\nThe class provides various public methods to perform squad-related operations. For example, the `Join` method allows a player to join a squad by setting the `squad` field to the specified index. The `Clear` method clears all squads and the current squad. The `Leave` method removes all squad members and resets the `squad` field and `isMatching` flag.\n\nThe `UpdateAlways` method is used to update squad information. It takes various parameters such as clan, index, memberCount, maxMember, win, draw, lose, leaderSeq, and leaderNickname. It updates the corresponding squad in the `dicSquad` dictionary or adds a new squad if it doesn't exist.\n\nThe class also provides methods to add and remove squad members, get squads and squad members as arrays, and retrieve specific squad members by sequence.\n\nOverall, the `SquadManager` class serves as a central component for managing squads and squad members in the Brick-Force project. It provides methods to perform various squad-related operations and stores squad and member information in dictionaries for easy access and manipulation.",

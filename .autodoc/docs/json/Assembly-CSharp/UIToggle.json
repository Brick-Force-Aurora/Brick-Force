  "summary": "The code provided is a class called `UIToggle` that extends the `UIBase` class. It is used to create a toggle button in a user interface (UI) for the larger Brick-Force project. \n\nThe `UIToggle` class has several properties and methods that are relevant to its purpose. \n\n- The `area` property is a `Vector2` that represents the size of the toggle button in the UI.\n- The `textKey` property is a string that can be used to retrieve the text to be displayed on the toggle button from a localization manager.\n- The `text` property is a string that holds the actual text to be displayed on the toggle button.\n- The `toggle` property is a boolean that represents the current state of the toggle button (true for toggled on, false for toggled off).\n- The `toggleOld` property is a boolean that represents the previous state of the toggle button.\n\nThe `Draw` method is responsible for rendering the toggle button in the UI. It first checks if the toggle button should be drawn by checking the `isDraw` property. If it is not set to true, the method returns false and the toggle button is not rendered. \n\nIf the `text` property is empty and the `textKey` property is not empty, the method retrieves the text from a localization manager using the `textKey` and displays it on the toggle button. Otherwise, it displays the text from the `text` property.\n\nThe `SetText` method is used to set the value of the `text` property. This allows the text on the toggle button to be dynamically changed.\n\nThe `isChangeToggle` method is used to check if the state of the toggle button has changed since the last frame. It compares the current state (`toggle`) with the previous state (`toggleOld`) and returns true if they are different, indicating that the toggle button has been toggled.\n\nOverall, this code provides a way to create and manage toggle buttons in the UI for the Brick-Force project. It allows for dynamic text changes and provides a way to check if the toggle button has been toggled.",
  "questions": "1. **What is the purpose of the `UIToggle` class?**\nThe `UIToggle` class is a subclass of `UIBase` and is used to create a toggle UI element with a text label.\n\n2. **What does the `Draw` method do?**\nThe `Draw` method is responsible for rendering the toggle UI element on the screen. It checks if the toggle has a text label and uses the appropriate method to render the toggle with or without the label.\n\n3. **What is the purpose of the `isChangeToggle` method?**\nThe `isChangeToggle` method is used to check if the toggle value has changed since the last frame. It compares the current toggle value with the previous toggle value and returns a boolean indicating whether there has been a change."

  "summary": "The code provided is a part of the Brick-Force project and it defines a class called \"Angles\". This class contains a single static method called \"ClampAngle\". \n\nThe purpose of the \"ClampAngle\" method is to restrict an input angle value within a specified range. It takes three parameters: \"angle\", \"min\", and \"max\". The \"angle\" parameter represents the input angle that needs to be clamped, while the \"min\" and \"max\" parameters define the lower and upper bounds of the allowed range.\n\nThe method first checks if the input angle is less than -360 degrees. If it is, the method adds 360 degrees to the angle to bring it within the range of -360 to 0 degrees. Similarly, if the angle is greater than 360 degrees, the method subtracts 360 degrees to bring it within the range of 0 to 360 degrees.\n\nAfter ensuring that the angle is within the -360 to 360 degree range, the method uses the Mathf.Clamp function to restrict the angle within the specified \"min\" and \"max\" range. The Mathf.Clamp function returns the input angle if it is within the range, otherwise it returns the closest value to the input angle that falls within the range.\n\nHere is an example usage of the \"ClampAngle\" method:\n\n```csharp\nfloat inputAngle = 400f;\nfloat minAngle = 0f;\nfloat maxAngle = 180f;\n\nfloat clampedAngle = Angles.ClampAngle(inputAngle, minAngle, maxAngle);\nDebug.Log(clampedAngle); // Output: 180\n```\n\nIn this example, the input angle is 400 degrees, which is outside the allowed range of 0 to 180 degrees. The \"ClampAngle\" method clamps the angle to the maximum allowed value of 180 degrees, and the resulting clamped angle is then logged to the console.",
  "questions": "1. **What does this code do?**\nThe code defines a class called \"Angles\" with a static method called \"ClampAngle\". This method takes in an angle value and two minimum and maximum values, and returns the angle value clamped between the minimum and maximum values.\n\n2. **What are the expected input and output of the \"ClampAngle\" method?**\nThe expected input for the \"ClampAngle\" method is a float angle value, and two float minimum and maximum values. The method returns a float value, which is the angle value clamped between the minimum and maximum values.\n\n3. **What is the purpose of the if statements in the \"ClampAngle\" method?**\nThe if statements check if the angle value is less than -360 or greater than 360, and if so, adjust the angle value to be within the range of -360 to 360. This ensures that the angle value is properly wrapped around within the valid range before being clamped between the minimum and maximum values."

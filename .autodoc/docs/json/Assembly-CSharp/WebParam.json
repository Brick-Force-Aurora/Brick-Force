  "summary": "The `WebParam` class in the `Brick-Force` project is responsible for managing and storing parameters related to web requests. It is a MonoBehaviour class, which means it can be attached to a GameObject in the Unity engine.\n\nThe `WebParam` class has a private string variable called `param` that is initially set to an empty string. This variable holds the web parameters.\n\nThere is also a private static instance of the `WebParam` class called `_instance`. This instance is used to access the `WebParam` class from other scripts in the project.\n\nThe `Parameters` property is a public getter that returns the value of the `param` variable. This allows other scripts to access the web parameters.\n\nThe `HasParameters` property is a public getter that returns a boolean value indicating whether the `param` variable has any parameters. It checks if the length of the `param` string is greater than 0.\n\nThe `Instance` property is a public getter that returns the `_instance` variable. It first checks if the `_instance` variable is null. If it is null, it tries to find an instance of the `WebParam` class in the scene using `Object.FindObjectOfType`. If it fails to find an instance, it logs an error message. Finally, it returns the `_instance` variable.\n\nThe `Awake` method is a Unity lifecycle method that is called when the script is first loaded. It uses `Object.DontDestroyOnLoad` to prevent the `WebParam` instance from being destroyed when a new scene is loaded.\n\nThe `SetLoginParameters` method is used to set the web parameters. It takes a string parameter called `parameters`. It logs a debug message with the provided parameters and assigns the `parameters` value to the `param` variable. It then finds a GameObject called \"Main\" in the scene and gets the `AutoLogout` component attached to it. If the component is found, it calls the `Relogin` method on the component, passing in the `param` variable.\n\nOverall, the `WebParam` class is responsible for managing and storing web parameters and providing access to them for other scripts in the project. It also has a method to set the web parameters and trigger a relogin process in the `AutoLogout` component.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `WebParam` class?\n- The `WebParam` class is used to store and manage parameters related to web requests.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `Instance` property?\n- The `Instance` property provides a singleton instance of the `WebParam` class, ensuring that only one instance of the class exists throughout the application.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `SetLoginParameters` method?\n- The `SetLoginParameters` method is used to set the login parameters for the web request and trigger a relogin process if a specific component is found in the scene."

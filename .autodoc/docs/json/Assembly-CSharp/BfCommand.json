  "summary": "The code provided defines a class called `BfCommand` that represents a command in the Brick-Force project. The purpose of this class is to encapsulate a command along with its arguments, allowing for easy manipulation and passing of commands within the project.\n\nThe class has three private fields: `cmd`, `arg1`, and `arg2`. `cmd` is of type `BF_COMMAND`, an enumeration that represents different types of commands. The `BF_COMMAND` enumeration includes values such as `WHISPER_CMD`, `CAMERA_CMD`, `GUI_CMD`, etc., each representing a specific command type. `arg1` and `arg2` are of type `string` and represent the arguments associated with the command.\n\nThe class provides public properties to access the private fields: `Cmd`, `Arg1`, and `Arg2`. These properties are read-only and allow external code to retrieve the values of the private fields.\n\nThe class also has a constructor that takes in three parameters: `_cmd`, `_arg1`, and `_arg2`. These parameters are used to initialize the private fields of the class. This constructor allows for the creation of a `BfCommand` object with the specified command type and arguments.\n\nThis `BfCommand` class can be used in the larger Brick-Force project to represent and handle different commands. For example, it can be used to create a command object for a whisper command with the sender and receiver as arguments:\n\n```csharp\nBfCommand whisperCommand = new BfCommand(BF_COMMAND.WHISPER_CMD, \"sender\", \"receiver\");\n```\n\nThe `BfCommand` object can then be passed to other parts of the project that handle commands, allowing them to easily access the command type and arguments.\n\nOverall, this code provides a simple and reusable way to represent and manipulate commands in the Brick-Force project.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `BF_COMMAND` enum? \n- The `BF_COMMAND` enum is used to define different types of commands that can be executed in the Brick-Force project.\n\n2. What are the possible values for the `BF_COMMAND` enum? \n- The possible values for the `BF_COMMAND` enum are `NONE`, `WHISPER_CMD`, `CAMERA_CMD`, `GUI_CMD`, `GOD_CMD`, `GHOST_CMD`, `SPEED_CMD`, `STRAIGHT_MOVEMENT_CMD`, `INVISIBLE_CMD`, `MUTE_CMD`, and `BAN_CMD`.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `BfCommand` class and its constructor? \n- The `BfCommand` class is used to represent a command in the Brick-Force project. The constructor is used to initialize the command, along with its two arguments."

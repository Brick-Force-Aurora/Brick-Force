  "summary": "The `BndMatchScore` class is a MonoBehaviour script that is used to display the scores and other information related to a match in the Brick-Force game. \n\nThe purpose of this code is to handle the display of the match scores, the background image, and the fonts used to display the scores. It also handles the flickering effect for the team scores.\n\nThe class has several public variables that can be set in the Unity editor or through code. These variables include the GUI depth, which determines the rendering order of the GUI elements, the fonts used for the red and blue team scores, the font used for the goal count, and the background image for the score display.\n\nThe class also has private variables that store the actual scores for the red and blue teams, as well as the offset for the palette when using the build gun. There are also Rect and Vector2 variables that define the positions and sizes of the score display elements.\n\nThe `Start` method initializes the variables and sends a score request to the server if the player is currently breaking into a match.\n\nThe `VerifyBndMatch` method checks if the `bndMatch` variable is null and assigns it the `BndMatch` component if it is.\n\nThe `OnTeamScore` method is called when the team scores are updated. It updates the red and blue team scores and sets the scale of the fonts to 2 to create a visual effect.\n\nThe `OnGUI` method is responsible for rendering the GUI elements. It checks if the GUI is enabled and retrieves the GUI skin. It then sets the GUI depth and enables or disables the GUI based on whether a modal dialog is open. It creates a group for the score display using the background image and draws the flickering effect for the team scores. It then prints the red and blue team scores and the goal count using the specified fonts and positions. Finally, it resets the GUI skin and enables the GUI.\n\nThe `Update` method is responsible for updating the flickering effect for the team scores.\n\nOverall, this code provides the functionality to display the match scores and related information in the Brick-Force game. It is likely used in the larger project to provide a visual representation of the current match progress to the players.",

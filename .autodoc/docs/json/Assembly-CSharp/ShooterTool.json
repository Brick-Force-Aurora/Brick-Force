  "summary": "The code provided is a class called \"ShooterTool\" that is part of the Brick-Force project. This class represents a tool that can be used by a player in the game. The purpose of this code is to define the behavior and functionality of the tool.\n\nThe class has several private variables, including \"coolTimeInst\" which represents the cooldown time for the tool, \"tools\" which represents the parent object that manages all the tools, \"desc\" which represents the description of the tool, \"item\" which represents the item associated with the tool, \"deltaTime\" which keeps track of the time passed since the last use of the tool, \"input\" which represents the input key for activating the tool, \"hotkey\" which represents the hotkey for the tool, \"active\" which determines if the tool is currently active, \"audio\" which represents the audio source for playing sounds, \"battleChat\" which represents the chat system in the game, and \"controller\" which represents the local controller of the player.\n\nThe class also has several properties such as \"Icon\" which returns the icon of the tool, \"Name\" which returns the name of the tool, \"Hotkey\" which returns the hotkey of the tool, \"IsActive\" which determines if the tool is currently active, \"CoolTime\" which returns the remaining cooldown time of the tool, and \"Amount\" which returns the amount of the tool item.\n\nThe class has a constructor that takes in various parameters to initialize the tool. It also has several methods such as \"ErrorSound\" which plays an error sound, \"Update\" which updates the state of the tool based on user input and game conditions, \"GetExternalCondition\" which checks if there are any external conditions that need to be met for the tool to be enabled, \"IsEnable\" which determines if the tool is currently enabled, \"StartCoolTime\" which starts the cooldown time for the tool, \"Use\" which is called when the tool is used, and various other methods for performing specific actions such as healing, respawning, charging ammo, and detecting heartbeats.\n\nOverall, this code defines the behavior and functionality of a tool in the Brick-Force game.

  "summary": "The code provided is a class called \"BndConfig\" that is part of the Brick-Force project. This class is responsible for managing the configuration and display of a room in the game. \n\nThe class contains various properties and methods that handle the configuration and display of the room. \n\nThe properties include:\n- \"nonavailable\": a Texture2D object that represents the thumbnail image of the room. \n- \"crdFrame\": a Rect object that represents the frame of the room. \n- \"crdThumbnail\": a Rect object that represents the thumbnail image of the room. \n- \"crdAlias\": a Vector2 object that represents the position of the room's alias. \n- \"crdMode\": a Vector2 object that represents the position of the room's mode. \n- \"crdConfigBtn\": a Rect object that represents the position of the room's configuration button. \n- \"crdOptionLT\": a Vector2 object that represents the position of the room's options. \n- \"crdLine\": a Rect object that represents the position of the room's dividing line. \n- \"optionLX\": a float value that represents the x-coordinate of the room's options. \n- \"optionRX\": a float value that represents the x-coordinate of the room's options. \n- \"diff_y\": a float value that represents the difference in y-coordinate between the room's options. \n- \"crdBox\": a Vector2 object that represents the size of the room's options box. \n- \"diff_y2\": a float value that represents the difference in y-coordinate between the room's options. \n- \"tooltipMessage\": a string that represents the tooltip message to be displayed. \n- \"clrValue\": a Color object that represents the color of the room's value. \n- \"weaponOptions\": an array of strings that represents the available weapon options for the room. \n- \"isRoom\": a boolean value that indicates whether the room is a valid room. \n\nThe methods include:\n- \"Start()\": a method that is called when the room starts. \n- \"OnGUI()\": a method that handles the graphical user interface (GUI) of the room. It displays the room's thumbnail, alias, mode, options, and configuration button. It also handles the display of tooltips. \n- \"DoOption(Room room)\": a method that handles the display of the room's options. It displays the build phase time, shoot phase time, repeat time, kill count, weapon option, break-in option, team balance option, and use build gun option. \n- \"ShowTooltip(int id)\": a method that displays the tooltip message. \n\nOverall, this code manages the configuration and display of a room in the Brick-Force game. It handles the GUI elements and options of the room, and provides methods for updating and displaying the room's information.",

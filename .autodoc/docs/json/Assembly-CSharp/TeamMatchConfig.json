  "summary": "The code provided is a class called \"TeamMatchConfig\" that is used in the larger Brick-Force project. This class is responsible for configuring and displaying various options and information related to a team match in the game.\n\nThe class contains several private variables that define the positions and dimensions of various GUI elements, such as thumbnails, labels, and buttons. These variables are used to position and size the GUI elements on the screen.\n\nThe class also contains an array of strings called \"weaponOptions\" that stores different weapon options for the team match. These options are used to display the selected weapon option for the match.\n\nThe class has a public method called \"OnGUI\" that is responsible for rendering the GUI elements on the screen. This method is called every frame and is responsible for updating and displaying the GUI elements based on the current state of the game.\n\nInside the \"OnGUI\" method, the class retrieves the thumbnail image for the current map from the \"RegMapManager\" and displays it on the screen. It also checks if the map is a new map or has certain tags (such as \"glory\", \"medal\", or \"gold ribbon\") and displays corresponding icons next to the thumbnail.\n\nThe method also displays the alias and mode of the current room, as well as various options related to the team match, such as time limit, kill count, weapon option, break-in option, team balance option, item drop option, and wanted option. These options are displayed as labels on the screen.\n\nThe class also handles tooltip functionality. If the user hovers over a GUI element and a tooltip message is available, the class displays the tooltip message in a separate window.\n\nOverall, the \"TeamMatchConfig\" class is responsible for configuring and displaying various options and information related to a team match in the Brick-Force game. It handles rendering GUI elements, retrieving and displaying map thumbnails, displaying icons based on map tags, and handling tooltip functionality.",

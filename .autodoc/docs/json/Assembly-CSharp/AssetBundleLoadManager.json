  "summary": "The code provided is for a class called `AssetBundleLoadManager`, which is a part of the larger Brick-Force project. The purpose of this class is to manage the loading and unloading of asset bundles in the game.\n\nThe class starts with an enumeration called `ASS_BUNDLE_TYPE`, which defines different types of asset bundles that can be loaded. These types include fonts, voices, brick materials, brick icons, item materials, item icons, item weaponbys, and a second type of voice.\n\nThe class also includes a nested class called `LoadedInfo`, which stores information about the loaded asset bundles. This information includes the type of asset bundle, the URL from which it was loaded, and the version of the asset bundle.\n\nThe class has several member variables, including a reference to the singleton instance of the class (`_instance`), a string variable for the resource server URL (`resourceServer`), a list of loaded asset bundles (`listLoaded`), a version number for the USK asset bundle (`usk_ver`), and a boolean variable for setting the font (`setfont`).\n\nThe class includes several methods for loading and getting asset bundles. The `getAssetBundle` method takes in the type of asset bundle, an assembly string, and a version number, and returns the corresponding asset bundle. The `load` method is used to load an asset bundle of a specific type, assembly string, and version number. It first checks if the resource server URL is empty and sets it if necessary. Then, it constructs the URL for the asset bundle based on the type and assembly string. It starts a coroutine called `downloadAB` to download the asset bundle and adds the loaded asset bundle information to the `listLoaded` list.\n\nThe `downloadAB` coroutine is responsible for downloading the asset bundle from the given URL and version number. It uses the `AssetBundleManager` class to download and get the asset bundle. Depending on the type of asset bundle, it performs different actions. For example, if the type is `VOICE`, it loads all audio clips from the asset bundle and adds them to the `VoiceManager` instance. If the type is `BRICK_MAT`, it loads all materials from the asset bundle and adds them to the `BrickManager` instance. After performing the necessary actions, it sets the corresponding boolean variable (`setfont`, `VoiceManager.bLoaded`, etc.) to true.\n\nThe `OnDestroy` method is called when the `AssetBundleLoadManager` instance is destroyed. It unloads all the loaded asset bundles using the `AssetBundleManager` class.\n\nIn summary, the `AssetBundleLoadManager` class is responsible for managing the loading and unloading of asset bundles in the Brick-Force game. It provides methods for loading and getting asset bundles of different types, and performs specific actions based on the type of asset bundle loaded.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `AssetBundleLoadManager` class?\n- The `AssetBundleLoadManager` class is responsible for loading and managing asset bundles for different types of assets such as fonts, voices, brick materials, and item icons.\n\n2. How does the `AssetBundleLoadManager` class handle different types of asset bundles?\n- The `AssetBundleLoadManager` class uses an enum called `ASS_BUNDLE_TYPE` to specify the type of asset bundle to load. It then constructs the appropriate URL based on the asset type and uses the `AssetBundleManager` class to download and load the asset bundle.\n\n3. How does the `AssetBundleLoadManager` class handle the loaded asset bundles?\n- The `AssetBundleLoadManager` class keeps track of the loaded asset bundles using a list of `LoadedInfo` objects. When the `AssetBundleLoadManager` is destroyed, it unloads all the loaded asset bundles by calling the `Unload` method of the `AssetBundleManager` class."

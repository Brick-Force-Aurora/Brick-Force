  "summary": "The `StringMgr` class is responsible for managing and loading string data used in the Brick-Force project. It provides methods to load string data from either a web server or the local file system, and allows for updating and retrieving string values based on a given key.\n\nThe `StringMgr` class contains a private variable `_dicString`, which is an array of dictionaries. Each dictionary in the array represents a different language option, with a total of 12 language options available. The dictionaries store the string values, with the key being the string identifier and the value being the actual string.\n\nThe `Load` method is used to load the string data. If the project is running in a web player, the `LoadFromWWW` coroutine is started, which downloads the string data from a specified URL. If the project is not running in a web player, the `LoadFromLocalFileSystem` method is called, which loads the string data from a local file.\n\nThe `ParseData` method is responsible for parsing the loaded string data and populating the `_dicString` dictionaries. It creates a new dictionary for each language option and adds the string values to the corresponding dictionary.\n\nThe `UpdateStrings` method is used to update the string values for a given key in multiple languages. It calls the `UpdateString` method for each language option, passing in the key, language option, and new string value.\n\nThe `Get` methods are used to retrieve string values based on a given key. The `Get` method without any additional parameters returns the string value for the current language option. The `Get` method with a default value parameter returns the string value for the current language option, or the default value if the key is not found. The `Get` method with a language option parameter returns the string value for the specified language option.\n\nOverall, the `StringMgr` class provides a centralized way to manage and access string data in the Brick-Force project. It allows for loading string data from different sources, updating string values, and retrieving string values based on a given key and language option.",
  "questions": "**Question 1:** What is the purpose of the `LoadFromWWW()` method and how does it work?\n- The `LoadFromWWW()` method is responsible for downloading a file from a specified URL and parsing its data. It uses the `WWW` class to make the request and the `CSVLoader` class to read and parse the data.\n\n**Question 2:** How are the string values stored and accessed in the code?\n- The string values are stored in a multidimensional dictionary called `_dicString`. Each dictionary within the array represents a different language option. The strings can be accessed using the `Get()` method, which takes a key and returns the corresponding value from the dictionary based on the current language option.\n\n**Question 3:** What is the purpose of the `UpdateStrings()` method and how is it used?\n- The `UpdateStrings()` method is used to update the string values for a specific key in multiple languages. It takes the key and the corresponding values for each language as parameters and updates the `_dicString` dictionary accordingly. This method is likely used for localization purposes, allowing the developer to easily update and manage the string values for different languages."
